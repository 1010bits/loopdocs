# Jaeb Observational Study

Are you using (or planning to use) the do-it-yourself Loop automated insulin delivery system? If so, you may be eligible to join an observational study of Loop users.

The study is being done in collaboration with Loop developers to collect information from adults and children with type 1 diabetes using Loop. It is being paid for by the Helmsley Charitable Trust. The purpose of the study is to collect information from 300 â€“ 1,000 adults and children with T1D using Loop in the United States. This information will be used to learn more about how well Loop works, what problems users have, how often severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis occur, and how well the system controls blood sugar levels.
