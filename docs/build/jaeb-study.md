# Jaeb Observational Study

## Announcement
Are you using (or planning to use) the do-it-yourself Loop automated insulin delivery system? If so, you may be eligible to join an observational study of Loop users.

The study is being done in collaboration with Loop developers to collect information from adults and children with type 1 diabetes using Loop. It is being paid for by the Helmsley Charitable Trust. The purpose of the study is to collect information from 300 â€“ 1,000 adults and children with T1D using Loop in the United States. This information will be used to learn more about how well Loop works, what problems users have, how often severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis occur, and how well the system controls blood sugar levels.

Visit: [http://www.jaeb.org/loopstudy](http://www.jaeb.org/loopstudy) for more information or to join the study.

## Cohort A

(DIY Katie, LoopDocs author, here clearing up some FAQs that we've had lately in Looped Group re: the Jaeb study. I'm posting this as an interested party, not as a representative of Jaeb.)

As part of that observational study, there's a particular set of participants anticipated that are users that are within their first 7 days of Loop use. Many users have private messaged me and said they were waiting to enroll in the study until they had more time to get used to the system.

Just to clarify, the study is actually very interested in new users (within 7 days of starting Loop); they even have a name of Cohort A.

The study is observational and open to a wide-variety of users. If you fall into Cohort A, please don't self-exclude because you had an impression that your data isn't valuable.

If you are close to 7 days, but maybe just a bit over...please don't self-exclude either. Just send an email to Loopstudy@jaeb.org and let them know that you're a Cohort A possibility and tell them what your situation is.

## Tidepool Mobile

If you aren't familiar with Tidepool previously, it is a non-profit dedicated to making diabetes data more accessible, actionable, and meaningful for people with diabetes, their care teams and researchers. You can read more about what you can use Tidepool for, beyond just the use associated with the Jaeb Study, over on [LoopTips data tools section](https://kdisimone.github.io/looptips/data/tidepool/).

The Jaeb Observational Study uses Tidepool Mobile app on the Looper's iPhone to upload diabetes-related Health data. For information about installing and using the Tidepool Mobile app, please check out these useful [help articles at Tidepool](https://support.tidepool.org/category/31-tidepool-mobile).

In a nutshell, you will:

1. Set up a free Tidepool account on a desktop computer using Chrome browser
2. Install Tidepool Mobile app from the iPhone's App store
3. Allow Tidepool to read all the diabetes-related Health data
4. Sign into your Tidepool account on the Tidepool Mobile app.
5. Start a manual sync of your Health data from within the Tidepool Mobile app
6. Share your Tidepool data with Jaeb (if you decide to enroll in Jaeb observational study)
7. That's it! Just keep your Tidepool Mobile app on in the background (aka, don't intentionally upswipe the app closed)

Just an FYI: The most frequent issue with Jaeb enrollment process, based on feedback from Looped group, is that users forget to "share" their data with Jaeb in their Tidepool account settings.  Please don't forget to set that up here:
