# Insulet Omnipods - Eros

Through the work of incredible people, Insulet's Omnipod (Eros) system is now Loop compatible. 

!!!info "Loop with Omnipod is still considered 'in-testing'"
    Despite your excitement that Loop's code for Omnipod use has been released publicly, please consider the following information. This is considered an experimental feature branch. People using an experimental feature branch should expect issues and be willing to participate in reporting and capturing any observed issues. The branch will be likely updated at a more frequent rate than a stable branch would be to push bug fixes. Therefore, testers should also be willing and able to regularly update their Loop app to capture those updates. Testers should ensure they have adequate supply of replacement pods in case of an increase in unexpected pod failure due to Loop testing. 

## Eros

Eros pods were launched in 2013 and continue to be sold by Insulet. As far as we know, there have been no plans or timelines announced for the discontinuation of Eros pods for existing customers. For clarity, from [Insulet's webpage](https://www.myomnipod.com/about):

Eros system has that PDM we all recognize from the last several years.

## DASH

Insulet has announced their DASH system as an eventual replacement for Eros. There has already been a limited release of DASH to a select group of users, with a wider public rollout of DASH expected in 2019. The DASH system has the newer, slimmer PDM and built in BLE communications in pod. Loop will not be compatible with the DASH system.
