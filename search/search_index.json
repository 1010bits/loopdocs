It is a stone resting on the boulders of work done by many others. The app is built on top of LoopKit . LoopKit is a set of frameworks that provide data storage, retrieval, and calculation, as well as boilerplate view controllers used in Loop. Important Please understand that this project: Is highly experimental Is not approved for therapy You take full responsibility for building and running this system and do so at your own risk. Using the open source Loop app template, you can build an insulin delivery system that uses specific commercial and open source hardware and software technologies to bring together the insulin pump, continuous glucose monitor (CGM), and insulin dosing algorithm to create a continuous insulin basal dosing \u201cLoop\u201d. This Loop predicts future glucose based on basal-rate schedules, carbohydrate intake, insulin on board, and current CGM readings. These glucose forecasts provide Loop with the information needed to recommend a temporary basal rate to attain a targeted glucose range in the future. The system can either operate as an \u201copen loop\u201d by making recommendations to the user for their approval before enacting or as a \u201cclosed loop\u201d by automatically setting the recommended temporary basal rate. You should undertake this project in stages. For example, first \u201copen loop\u201d to familiarize yourself with Loop\u2019s operation. Also, investigate the code to ensure you understand what it is recommending and why. Then when you progress to \u201cclosed loop\u201d, do so safely by starting with appropriate safety limits and only progress to higher limits after several days of no lows. Please ask questions at this point about why Loop is making the recommendations it does. It should be similar to the therapy decisions you would make yourself. If the recommendations it makes are different than you would make, try to figure out why. Development History \u2301 Loop has been developed as an open-source, shared project. For a really interesting read about the history of Loop development, check out this History of Loop and LoopKit post, written by Loop developer Nate Racklyeft. The project continues to be a labor-of-love by a community of users; maintained and improved by volunteers.

Another screen will appear, fill in a title and click button to create the pull request, and then you can Merge pull request , and finally Confirm merge . Your cgm-remote-monitor repository is now up-to-date. Nice work. Heroku Nightscout Site Setup \u2301 Create an account at Heroku and choose the Primary Development Language to be Node.js when you create your account. You\u2019re going to use a free account, but you will still need to enter credit card information for your account setup. Don\u2019t forget to check your email to confirm your Heroku account. Go to your Nightscout cgm-remote-monitor repository in GitHub (https://github.com/yourGitHubname/cgm-remote-monitor) Scroll down until you see the purple Deploy to Heroku button. Click that button. Give your app a name, this will be the prefix of your NS site\u2019s URL. For example, https://yourappname.herokuapp.com Fill out the information lines in the Config Variables Section of that page, as shown below. Some of the lines can stay with the default entries already provided. KEY VALUE API_SECRET Create your own API_SECRET\u2026this is like the password to your NS site.

BG_LOW Enter the numeric value of the BG you\u2019d like as an urgent low alarm. PUSHOVER lines Can be left blank for now. See PUSHOVER section if you want to integrate PUSHOVER notifications with NS later. CUSTOM_TITLE This will be the text displayed in the upper left part of the NS website. THEME change from default to colors BRIDGE_USER_NAME Enter your Dexcom Share Account login name. This should be the same account name used in the Share2 or G5 Mobile app. BRIDGE_PASSWORD Enter your Dexcom Share Account password. BG_TARGET TOP Enter the numeric value of the top of your target BG. BG_TARGET_BOTTOM Enter the numeric value of the bottom of your target BG. The remaining variables can be left at their default values. Click the purple Deploy button at the bottom of screen Wait a little bit while Heroku builds your NS app. You\u2019ll see some text scroll by in the Build App box, and then finally, you will have a message that the NS app was successfully deployed. You can verify your site\u2019s successful build by clicking View (you should see black site with a profile warning). You will be redirected to a profile set-up page. (If it doesn't redirect automatically, refresh your webpage). You do not have to enter all the information in the profile if you are using Loop (since Loop will be providing the information for IOB and COB rather than letting NS calculate them), but you do have to fill out the Basal Profile and TimeZone at a minimum in order to have your temp basals properly display. Click Save when you have entered the information. You will be prompted to authenticate, if it is the first time you\u2019ve used the device to make changes in your profile. Click on the Authenticate link at the bottom of the site, and enter your API_SECRET to complete the authentication. Assuming your previous browser tab is still open for \"Create a new App | Heroku\", let's go back to that tab. This time instead of choosing the View option, we are going to select the Manage App button. Then, select the Settings tab near the top of the screen on your Heroku app. Click on Reveal Config Vars . Scroll down the bottom of the Config Vars lines until you find the last blank one. You are going to add several additional lines of config vars for Loop use; the DEVICESTATUS_ADVANCED is a required line, the others just make Nightscout more useful when Looping.

Click on Open App in the top right corner of your Heroku site. Click on the settings (those three horizontal lines in upper right corner). Now check that your basal render is selected to either default or icicle (personal preference for how the temp basals show as blue lines in NS site), check the boxes that you\u2019d like display pills in the SHOW PLUGINS (usually all of them), and then press save. Your new Nightscout site is all set-up. Congrats! Migrate mLab database \u2301 If you\u2019d like to seamlessly keep all your old Azure NS data showing in your new Heroku NS site, you\u2019ll need to copy and paste your old MONGODB string from your Azure site. Find it in either Application Settings or Connection strings in your Azure control panel and then go to Heroku\u2019s MONGODB_URI line. Replace the content with your copied string from Azure. Double check that your Azure collection used the \u201centries\u201d name\u2026if it doesn\u2019t, then you will need to update that variable in Heroku to match as well. EVENT HISTORY \u2301 Don't forget to keep you Loop App's Preferred Source set to Event History if you want your NS site to smoothly integrate. Preferred Source set to Reservoir will result in carbs not being uploaded and temp basals not being displayed.","title":"Azure to Heroku"},{"location":"nightscout/azure_migration/#migrating-from-azure-to-heroku","text":"If you are a current Azure user who wants to move to Heroku, but not lose all your old NS data, you will need do the following steps: update your repository in GitHub create a new heroku nightscout site migrate your mLab database to new site","title":"Migrating from Azure to Heroku"},{"location":"nightscout/azure_migration/#updating-your-repository-in-github","text":"Copy, paste, and goto the one of the following links depending on which branch of cgm-remote-monitor you are currently running (replace yourgithubname with your actual GitHub user name) for master branch deployments: https://github.com/yourgithubname/cgm-remote-monitor/compare/master...nightscout:master For dev branch deployments: https://github.com/yourgithubname/cgm-remote-monitor/compare/dev...nightscout:dev Click the big green Create pull request button.

By using IFTTT, you can have single button presses that you can deploy from your iPhone to put a note in your NS site, enter low treatments, log a site change, or log a sensor change. IFTTT Setup for phones \u2301 First we need to gather one thing called your \"hashed API Secret\". In your internet browser, open a console window while viewing your Nightscout site. Make sure you have \"authenticated\" your site by using your API secret in the Nightscout settings area (hint: if you see a little padlock in the upper left corner of the site, you haven't authenticated it). Refresh the site and your hashed secret key will be shown as \"apisecrethash: \"xxxxxxxxxx...\"\" For Safari users on Mac, you can open the console window by selecting \"Develop\" from the Safari top menu, and then \"Show Page Source\" (if you do not see \"Develop\" in the top menu, activate it by going to Safari > Preferences... > Advanced, and checking the \"Show Develop menu in menu bar\" option). If you're having problems seeing the apisecrethash, click the little grey triangle next to the \"status isAuthenticated\" line and the objects below it will display (see screenshot). Your hashed API secret can be copied and pasted from that line, as shown below. Save that somewhere easy to get to again, because you will be using it later. Get an IFTTT account Login to your IFTTT.com account and select the \"New Applet\" button. In the screen that appears, click on the blue \"+this\" part of the screen In the next screen, type \"button\" in the search field and then click on the red box labelled \"ButtonWidget\" Connect the buttonwidget by clicking on the large red \"connect\" button (You will only have to \"connect\" the widgets for the first applet you make. After that the widgets will already connected to your IFTTT account.) Click on the large red \"button press\" box Click on the blue \"+that\" text Enter \"Webhooks\" in the search field and click on the Webhooks app Connect the Webhooks app Select the blue \"Make a Web Request\" box Now you will have a blank web request template to complete. Screenshot below is an example of a completed recipe for eating soon IFTTT action. The following info should be filled in: URL : https://yoursite.herokuapp.com/api/v1/treatments.json ( change the \"yoursite\" part to your NS info ) Method : POST Content Type : application/json Body : The content of the body will depend on the action that you would like this particular button press to perform. You can only do ONE of the actions per button. There are many recipes available, but not all will work with Loop and NS together. For example, you can use the Low Treatment recipe to log carbs to NS...but Loop will not read/use those carbs. That may still be helpful though for remote care givers to leave an indication of when they gave uncovered carbs to treat a low. You could also set temp targets in NS using IFTTT (recipes can be found on OpenAPS docs), but Loop does not read temp targets from Nightscout at this time. Some sample content for actions that may be useful in Loop: Pump Site Change {\"enteredBy\": \"IFTTT-button\", \"eventType\": \"Site Change\", \"duration\": 0, \"secret\": \"your_hashed_api_goes_here!!!\"} CGM Sensor Start {\"enteredBy\": \"IFTTT-button\", \"eventType\": \"Sensor Start\", \"duration\": 0, \"secret\": \"your_hashed_api_goes_here!!!\"} Note {\"enteredBy\": \"IFTTT-button\", \"eventType\": \"Note\", \"notes\": \"Hi mom, please don't text me for a bit. I'm taking a test.\", \"secret\": \"your_hashed_api_goes_here!!!\"} Low Treatment {\"enteredBy\": \"IFTTT-button\", \"reason\": \"low treatment\", \"carbs\": 15, \"secret\": \"your_hashed_api_goes_here!!!\"} Click the Create Action button on the bottom of the screen when you finish. Now is your chance to change the title of your Applet now to something meaningful. You can turn on notifications, too, using the slider shown. If you turn on the notifications, you will get an alert on your phone and pebble watch when the button press has been successfully deployed. Finish the IFTTT button by clicking on the Finish button that appears. Repeat the setup for New Applets for as many automated actions as you would like to setup. Enable IFTTT in your Nightscout site \u2301 Find your Maker Key by going to your IFTTT account, Services and then click on the Webhooks service, settings. You will see your Maker Key as the last part of the URL; copy and paste that last part (the red circled part as shown) Login to your Nightscout site host (azure or heroku) and (1) add your Maker Key to the MAKER_KEY line and (2) add \"maker\" to your ENABLE line. Install IFTTT app on your iPhone/Android \u2301 Download the IFTTT app on your phone and log in. You can add homescreen quick buttons. Click on your IFTTT app and login, click on My Applets in the bottom right corner, and then click on the applet that you'd like to work with. From the the middle of the applet, click on the Widget Settings, and then click on the Add button for the Homescreen Icon. For iPhone users, if you downswipe from the top of your iPhone screen, you will have the Today view or Notifications showing. They are separate pages; Today view is on the left, Notifications is on the right. You can left/right swipe to go between them. Go into the Today view and scroll to the bottom, click \"edit\". This should show a list of existing widgets, followed by a list of \"more widgets\" with green + signs. Click on the IFTTT's green circle and the widget will be moved to the top, active widgets area. You can hold your finger on the three left lines of the IFTTT widget row to drag it to the top of your widget panel, if you prefer to have it as the top-most widget. If you end up with more than four IFTTT applets, they will appear in reverse-order of when they were created...which may not be the same as you'd prefer them to appear on your widget bar. If you'd like to reorder them: go into your iPhone's IFTTT app click on My Applets click on the gear icon in upper left of screen click on Widgets click on the pencil icon in upper right of screen click and hold the three lines that appear on the right side of the widget that you want to move. Drag the widget to the order in the list that you'd like it to appear in your widget quickscreen. Alexa integration \u2301 Since you have IFTTT/Maker requests working, you can get it to work with anything that supports IFTTT, including Alexa. You will need to add \"alexa\" to your ENABLE line in your Nightscout host settings (azure) or config vars (heroku). And then repeat the steps above, but instead of using \"ButtonWidget\" service we started with earlier (the \"+if\" part of the setup)...you will use the \"AmazonAlexa\" service. Alexa requests do not need underscores, FYI.","title":"IFTTT"},{"location":"nightscout/ifttt/#ifttt-integration","text":"If This, Then That (IFTTT) is a useful Nightscout integration.

It allows for easy remote monitoring of Loop activities, troubleshooting of Loop errors, history of CGM, carbs, boluses, & temp basals, reports to analyze data trends and patterns. There is a Nightscout app in your iPhone App Store, or you can use a web browser to view the data. Setting up Nightscout is free and fairly quick. Once setup, the site can be accessed by anyone that you share your unique Nightscout URL with. Nightscout is highly recommended for Loop users, especially those using Loop as caregivers to t1ds. Nightscout displays are often the easiest way to troubleshoot Loop settings, if you are having problems and seeking input from others. Below is some discussion about the general Nightscout display, as well as some Loop-specific display information. Blood Glucose Your blood glucose (BG) readings from your CGM are shown in green, yellow, or red in the main graph area of NS. You can adjust your high and low BG targets in NS (when NS alerts will start for high/low BGs), but those will not affect your Loop performance. Loop only uses the BG targets given in the Loop app settings. The main screen of BGs is displaying the time duration you have selected (in the example above, 12 hours of BG history). The bottom of the screen shows the last 48-hours of BG trends. You can scan backwards by dragging the bottom timeline to the left, if you want to review specific Loop actions or data in the last two days. Carbs Carbs are automatically uploaded to NS by the Loop app. The amount of carbs on board (active carbs or COB) can be seen by clicking the Loop pill. The size of a white carb dot on the graph is proportional to the amount of carbs entered...bigger meals get bigger dots. Loop does not read carbs from NS for use in looping caluclations, it only uploads carbs to NS that have been entered in the Loop app. Boluses Insulin boluses are also automatically uploaded to NS by the Loop app. The bolus is shown as a filled in blue lower-half of the dot, and the specific amount of the bolus is also shown. There may be a slight delay between when the carbs for a meal are uploaded to NS to when the meal bolus appears. This is because depending on the pump model and size of bolus, the bolus may take a few minutes to actually be given and then Loop has to perform a pump read to verify the reservoir volume has decreased (i.e., the bolus was given). As shown in the example above, the meal carbs have been uploaded, but the bolus delivery is still in progress. Insulin on board (active insulin or IOB) is also shown in the Loop pill. Temp Basals Within your NS profile, you will enter in the scheduled basal for your t1d. This is not automatically updated when you update the Loop app or your pump; you will have to manually update your basal profile in your NS site if you change your basal profile in Loop and/or pump. If you don't update the NS basal profile, it doesn't cause any problems in Loop function...you simply won't have accurate VISUAL representation of high/low temp basals within NS. The dashed blue line represents the scheduled basal profile (as entered in your NS profile). The solid blue lines indicate the actual basal amounts set for a given time...so as Loop sets temp basals higher or lower than your scheduled basal rate, the solid blue line will jump above or below your dashed blue line. There is a slight delay (up to 2-5 minutes) in the rendering of basal changes on the blue lines, so if you want the accurate current basal rate, you can check the Loop pill. Predicted BG The purple line to the right of the BG is Loop's predicted BG. Watching the behavior of that purple line can help you understand why Loop is making decisions regarding high or low temps. You can read more on that topic in the Algorithm section of these docs. Loop pill The Loop pill is the little display box which when hovered over, or clicked, will provide additional information about recent Loop activities and status. Information included is the last time Loop ran, the temp basal set, IOB, and COB. Looking at the Loop pill is a quick method for assessing if you loop is currently active, as well. The small symbols to the right of the word Loop have specific meaning. The small horizontal lightning bolt, shown in this example, is an active loop which recently enacted a temp basal. You can read the section on Troubleshooting using the Loop Pill for additional information about the various symbols. SAGE and CAGE pills The SAGE and CAGE pills are for Sensor Age and Cannula Age. These optional pills track the time since your CGM sensor and Pump site were last changed. You can set up custom alerts to remind you when it is time to change the devices, or simply use the visuals to keep track of your particular timing for site/sensor changes.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"nightscout/overview/#overview","text":"Nightscout (NS) is an excellent tool to remotely view Loop's actions.

We can achieve this functionality through a combination of Nightscout, IFTTT, Google, and Pushover. Traditionally, most people may already know of Pushover alerts through their NS site. The old Loop docs had setup for how to add your PUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY , PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN , and PUSHOVER_USER_KEY in your Heroku settings to get notifications on the non-looping phones of parents and caregivers. The drawback for that method is that you could not necessarily fine tune the alerts (maybe you wanted battery alarms on your NS website, but not get pushovers for them...a bit hard to separate out the environments that way) and Pushover had a demanding acknowledgement requirement. If you failed to acknowledge an alert, you may end up getting alarm fatigue fairly quickly as the alarm repeated itself. Using Pushover THROUGH IFTTT however, we can improve the possible notifications and who receives which ones. For example, a teenage Looper may want notifications when his/her pump site needs changing and when his/her dexcom is about to expire in the next day. S/he already gets local notifications on his/her phone via Loop for low reservoir volumes, low pump battery, and Loop failures. Dexcom app provides high/low BG notifications locally, too. If s/he were to get those same alarms via Pushover, s/he would inevitably get alarm fatigue. A remotely-monitoring parent may want additional information, like a pushover alerts when the school nurse bolused for lunch, as well as Loop failures, low iPhone battery level for the child, low pump battery, and other such information that might be useful. Perhaps there's also an emergency contact person that you only want to get high/low BG alerts...you can set that up as well quite easily. The basic concept is that NS puts out an event that triggers the IFTTT service called Webhooks (old name was \"Maker Webhooks\" hence you may see references to \"maker\" in NS docs). Actually, there are several types of events that NS has programmed in all ready to use in IFTTT. For this setup, we are going to use the most general logging event called ns-event . You'll get all the alarms and notifications logged, and then you can decide in subsequent steps which ones you'd actually like to send to your phone for pushover notification. As a brief roadmap for what we are going to do: Get necessary accounts setup Add a folder to your Google Drive Make an IFTTT applet to log NS events to your Google Spreadsheets Enable NS to work with that new IFTTT applet Make an IFTTT applet to send Pushover alert when the Google Spreadsheet is updated Get Prepped \u2301 If you don't already have these steps done, you will need them. Skip any that you already have done. Setup a Nightscout site Get an IFTTT account Get a Pushover Account Get a Google Account Download the Pushover app onto your phone, and any other phone you'd like to receive Pushover alerts Download the IFTTT app onto your phone, and any other phone you'd like to use IFTTT applets on Login to the Pushover and IFTTT apps with your login information Add a Google Drive folder \u2301 Login to your Google account and select Google Drive Click on the blue \"New\" button and create a new folder named IFTTT. Double click on the newly created IFTTT folder, select the blue \"New\" button again, and create a new subfolder called \"Nightscout-Alarms\" This IFTTT/Nightscout-Alarms folder will eventually contain numerous Google Spreadsheets, one for each NS alarm or infomation that is logged. As new alarms are triggered, the IFTTT applet we are about to write will add a row to the appropriate spreadsheet logging the time of the alarm and any other reported details that go with the entry. For now though, your drive will be blank...screenshot below just to give you an idea of where we are going.

In the screen that appears, click on the blue \"+this\" part of the screen In the next screen, type \"webhooks\" in the search field and then click on the blue connect button If this is the first time you are using IFTTT Webhooks service, you will have a \"Connect\" button to select. If you already have IFTTT applets using Webhooks, you won't see this screen...just move to the next bullet. Click on the \"receive a web request\" blue box, and then fill in the Event Name as ns-event and then press the \"Create trigger\" button. (Side note: the event name used here corresponds to the triggers discussed above for core events that NS already has integrated for IFTTT users. If you want to instead use the other triggers such as ns-warn or ns-urgent, you can. This example is using the most general trigger so that the options are wider for most users.) Click on the blue \"+that\" text Enter google in the search field and click on the Google Sheets icon Select the green \"Add row to spreadsheet\" box Delete the contents of the \"Spreadsheet Name\" and \"Drive folder path\". For the \"Spreadsheet Name\", click the \"Add Ingredient\" button and select the \"Value1\". For the \"Drive folder path\", enter IFTTT/Nightscout-Alarms . You do not have to modify the \"Formatted row\" box's contents. Click the \"Create action\" button at the bottom. Turn off the toggle for receiving notifications when the applet runs, and then click the Finish button You'll now have the finished IFTTT applet that will cause a row to be added to a Google spreadsheet...tracking all your NS notifications and alarms. If it is the first time that alarm has been logged, the applet will also create the spreadsheet itself. After awhile, your IFTTT/Nightscout-Alarms folder will start to look like the screenshot posted above with numerous spreadsheets for each alarm type. Enable IFTTT Webhooks in your Nightscout site \u2301 If you already have created IFTTT buttons previously to work with your NS site, you can skip this section. If those buttons are working, then you've already added your MAKER_KEY and \"maker\" to your ENABLE line in Heroku. To actually make that first applet work, we need to enter a \"Maker Key\" to get NS and IFTTT talking to each other. Find your Maker Key by going to your IFTTT account, Services and then clicking on Webhooks. (Your screen may not have as many services showing; the example account below just happens to already use several services.) You will see your Maker Key as the last part of the URL; copy that last part (the red circled part) Navigate to your Heroku account's settings tab, \"reveal config vars\" and (1) add your Maker Key to the MAKER_KEY line and (2) add \"maker\" to your ENABLE line. Make 2nd IFTTT Applet to send Pushover notifications \u2301 In your IFTTT account, select the \"New Applet\" button. In the screen that appears, click on the blue \"+this\" part of the screen In the next screen, type \"google\" in the search field and then click on the \"Google Sheets\" logo. Click on the \"New row added to spreadsheet\" as the trigger. Enter the following information: Folder path is IFTTT/Nightscout-Alarms and for filename you are going to enter the name of the particular NS alarm or information that you would like to get pushover alerts for. Click on the \"Create trigger\" button to save the trigger. This applet can't be created unless your filename (alarm spreadsheet) already exists. If your 1st applet we created above hasn't run for a long time, the spreadsheets may not exist yet because the alarms haven't triggered. You have two options...(1) manually create the file in your Google Drive so that you can finish the applet now or (2) wait several days/weeks for the alarms to happen and that will automatically create the files in your Google drive. If you choose option 1, here's a partial list of some of the filenames you could create in advance: Loop isn't looping Cannula age 48 hours Cannula age 72 hours Meal Bolus Warning, Pump Reservoir Low Warning Uploader Battery is Low Depending on your alert levels you specified in NS, some of the hours in the titles may vary to match your settings Click on the blue \"+that\" text Enter pushover in the search field and click on the Pushover icon. If this is your first time linking your IFTTT to Pushover, you will be prompted to enter your Pushover account login and allow IFTTT access. This only needs to be done once. Select the \"Send a Pushover notification\" box Delete the contents of the \"Title\" and \"Message\" and \"URL\" boxes. For the Title, click the \"Add Ingredient\" button and add ColumnC . For the \"Message\", click the \"Add Ingredient\" button and add the values of various columns from your spreadsheet for the infomation you would like to include. For the alerts: ColumnC contains the alarm name, ColumnA is the date/time of the alarm, and ColumnD has the more detailed information about the info/alarm. This is a pretty decent recipe to follow to get the useful information in your notification. Select the \"Message Priority\" that you would like for this particular alarm type. Select the \"Device\" that you would like to receive this particular alarm type. The devices listed will be all your devices that have Pushover app installed and logged into. Click \"Create Action\" when you are finished. You'll now have made the IFTTT applet that will cause a Pushover notification to a particular device for a particular NS alarm, once the first applet records the alarm in the google spreadsheet. Keep the \"receive notification when this Applet runs\" toggled off and click the Finish button. Revisit Nightscout Alert Levels \u2301 Putting all these notifications together may cause you to want to revisit the alert levels you have set in your Heroku settings. Here's a short summary of NS for the looping-related alerts (Note: the last row, Upbat, is the Looping iPhone battery level for Loop users; or the rig's battery level for OpenAPS users.) If you'd like some of these alarms for your site and don't currently have them activated (they are all off by default unless specifically turned on), the lines you'd need to add are in the last column. If you like the default values of the WARN and/or URGENT, you don't have to add those extra lines...just the line to enable the alerts will be sufficient. SETTING DEFAULT WARN DEFAULT URGENT HEROKU SETTINGS CAGE 48 72 CAGE_ENABLE_ALERTS = true CAGE_WARN=XX CAGE_URGENT=XX SAGE 164 168 SAGE_ENABLE_ALERTS = true SAGE_WARN=XX SAGE_URGENT=XX IAGE 48 72 IAGE_ENABLE_ALERTS = true IAGE_WARN=XX IAGE_URGENT=XX LOOP 30 60 LOOP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true LOOP_WARN=XX LOOP_URGENT=XX OPENAPS 30 60 OPENAPS_ENABLE_ALERTS = true OPENAPS_WARN=XX OPENAPS_URGENT=XX PUMP_CLOCK 30 60 PUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true PUMP_WARN_CLOCK=XX PUMP_URGENT_CLOCK=XX PUMP_RES 10 5 PUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true PUMP_WARN_RES=XX PUMP_URGENT_RES=XX PUMP_BATT_P 30 20 PUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true PUMP_WARN_BATT_P=XX PUMP_URGENT_BATT_P=XX PUMP_BATT_V 1.35 1.30 PUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS = true PUMP_WARN_BATT_V=XX PUMP_URGENT_BATT_V=XX UPBAT 30 20 UPBAT_ENABLE_ALERTS = true UPBAT_WARN=XX UPBAT_URGENT=XX Final notes \u2301 You can use other notification services than Pushover in the last part of the second applet. For example, you could use the SMS service to send text notifications to your iphone instead of Pushover. The downside for that is that the SMS service is limited to 100 message each month...some users may exceed that pretty easily. Another alternative notification would be IFTTT's own Notification service. This would work well, but does not have the ability to distinguish between devices the way Pushover allows. If you use IFTTT's Notifications service, every phone using your IFTTT account will get the notices. To be clear, you do NOT need to have pushover on your ENABLE line nor have PUSHOVER_USER_KEY , PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN , or PUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY entered into your Heroku settings in order for any of the above to work. This is not the same Pushover as NS has integrated into it's code. This is actually through IFTTT services, you just need a Pushover account to link to during the 2nd applet setup. To create more notifications, simply repeat the steps for the 2nd applet you created, only this time use a new filename that corresponds to the spreadsheet tracking the alert you'd like notifications for. You'll end up with multiple applets of the dark blue type (the pushover notifiers) and only a single light blue (NS alarm general collecter). Here's examples of the Meal Bolus and Temp Basal ns-event logging spreadsheets The 1st applet can only create up to 2000 active rows in a given spreadsheet. After that, the applet will automatically create a new spreadsheet. For most alarms, it may take quite sometime to reach 2000 rows of info. For other alerts, such as temp basals being set, that may fill up rather fast for the average looper. You can either clean out the data rows periodically to make room, or update your filename in the 2nd applet periodically when a new spreadsheet is made.","title":"Remote Notifications"},{"location":"nightscout/pushover/#remote-notifications","text":"While Loop app currently sends notifications locally on Loop user's iPhone, parents and caregivers likely want those messages on their phones, too. We can achieve this functionality through a combination of Nightscout, IFTTT, Google, and Pushover. Traditionally, most people may already know of Pushover alerts through their NS site. The old Loop docs had setup for how to add your PUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY , PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN , and PUSHOVER_USER_KEY in your Heroku settings to get notifications on the non-looping phones of parents and caregivers. The drawback for that method is that you could not necessarily fine tune the alerts (maybe you wanted battery alarms on your NS website, but not get pushovers for them...a bit hard to separate out the environments that way) and Pushover had a demanding acknowledgement requirement. If you failed to acknowledge an alert, you may end up getting alarm fatigue fairly quickly as the alarm repeated itself. Using Pushover THROUGH IFTTT however, we can improve the possible notifications and who receives which ones. For example, a teenage Looper may want notifications when his/her pump site needs changing and when his/her dexcom is about to expire in the next day. S/he already gets local notifications on his/her phone via Loop for low reservoir volumes, low pump battery, and Loop failures. Dexcom app provides high/low BG notifications locally, too. If s/he were to get those same alarms via Pushover, s/he would inevitably get alarm fatigue. A remotely-monitoring parent may want additional information, like a pushover alerts when the school nurse bolused for lunch, as well as Loop failures, low iPhone battery level for the child, low pump battery, and other such information that might be useful. Perhaps there's also an emergency contact person that you only want to get high/low BG alerts...you can set that up as well quite easily. The basic concept is that NS puts out an event that triggers the IFTTT service called Webhooks (old name was \"Maker Webhooks\" hence you may see references to \"maker\" in NS docs). Actually, there are several types of events that NS has programmed in all ready to use in IFTTT. For this setup, we are going to use the most general logging event called ns-event . You'll get all the alarms and notifications logged, and then you can decide in subsequent steps which ones you'd actually like to send to your phone for pushover notification.

It is broken up into 3 main display areas; Heads Up display (HUD), Charts, and Toolbar. The HUD is the top area of the screen. This shows status of the last time loop ran, current BG Reading, current temp basal, current insulin reservoir volume remaining, and current pump percentage battery remaining. The next area is the charting area. This includes, glucose trend and prediction, Active Insulin, Insulin Delivery, and Carbohydrates. The final display area is the toolbar which has buttons for Carbs, Pre-Meal, Bolus, Workout Mode, and Settings. Heads Up Display \u2301 Loop Status \u2301 The Loop Status is the colored circle in the upper left corner of the main Loop display. There are four colors that are typically displayed. A grey circle indicates the Loop is warming up and hasn\u2019t yet completed its initial loop. When the Loop is first activated, it may take about 15-20 minutes to complete the first Loop, and the grey circle will be displayed. It needs CGM data to be gathered, so be patient. When it finally completes its first loop, the circle will turn green. If you can't get your grey loop to turn green, please see the Grey Loop troubleshooting page for tips. A green circle indicates the Loop has been successfully completed within the last 5 minutes. The time since the loop last completed will be displayed under the circle. A yellow circle indicates the Loop has not completed in the last 5-15 minutes. It is not unusual to have a few instances of yellow circles throughout a day of looping. They can be caused by temporarily getting too far away from RileyLink or iPhone (more than about 3-10 feet depending on conditions), CGM failing to read or being in ???, radio frequency \u201cnoise\u201d interference, and such. Generally, most yellow circles will self-resolve without needing any special troubleshooting. A red circle indicates the Loop has not completed in over 15 minutes. This is not a typical state, and you should troubleshoot why Loop is not completing. Please review the Yellow and Red Loop troubleshooting page for tips on how to get your green Loop back. Clicking on the red circle will also pop-up the last error message to help guide your troubleshooting. When the circle is notched and not complete, that means the Loop is operating in \u201copen loop\u201d mode. When the \u201cclosed loop\u201d setting is turned on, the loop status will show a completed circle. The loop status circle will pulse slightly when RileyLink is giving the pump a new temp basal setting. The pulsing will stop when the temp basal has been set by the pump. Glucose \u2301 The current BG reading from the CGM will display, including trending arrow and time the reading was taken. If the BG is being read straight from the G5 transmitter or G4 receiver, no special symbols will appear. If the BG is being read from the Dexcom Share Servers, a small cloud icon will be in the corner of the BG reading. Internet access is required to run in this mode. When you first start Loop, there may be a small yellow alert next to the BG. This should go away within a short period of time (around 5 minutes or less). If the yellow alert remains, something may be wrong with fetching BG data. You can try restarting the Loop app (double tap home button, upswipe on app to close) to see if BG data will resume. Special note for Dexcom G5 users , a yellow alert will appear when a calibration is needed. The alert will clear once the calibration is given, but typically Loop will work IF the yellow alert is only for a needed G5 calibration. Temp Basal \u2301 The temp basal will display the enacted temp basal change relative to the scheduled basal. So if the scheduled basal was 1.0 units per hour and Loop has set a temp basal of 0.2 units per hour, the temp basal icon will display -0.8 U, as shown in graphic to the left. Reservoir \u2301 The reservoir icon will remain grey and plain until insulin volume decreases. At 25% reservoir volume remaining, the reservoir icon will turn yellow. At 10% reservoir volume remaining, the reservoir icon will turn red. The remaining units will be displayed when it gets to these lower thresholds. Battery \u2301 For x23, x54 pumps, the battery icon will show 100/75/50/25% increments just as the pump does. As the battery level decreases, the icon will turn from grey to yellow to red. For x22 pumps, the battery icon will read discrete % values. The warning colors/levels on Loop's battery indicator work in conjunction with the type of battery selected. If you change battery types, please make sure to update your battery selection in the Loop app settings. The pump's on-screen battery indicator is not a good indicator of remaining battery life for the purposes of looping. Loop's pump communications will fail from low battery levels sooner than the insulin delivery will fail. The Loop's battery level warnings are designed to give you approximately 8 hours of notice before the pump battery will need changing. Charts \u2301 There are several charts that help you navigate your Loop actions. Clicking on each of the charts will also open up additional information. Glucose Chart \u2301 The glucose chart displays BG values in your preferred units. The vertical scale of the chart is calculated on the fly by Loop to be as useful as possible while including the highest and lowest readings in the chart. The horizontal axis is set to go forward from the current time until your DIA forward (so you can see what Loop eventually thinks BG will be). It then goes back in time as far as it can based upon the width in pixels of your screen. Note, if you turn your device to landscape mode you will have more screen real estate and thus will be able to see further back in time. If you would like to see further back in time you can use Nightscout or you can modify your Loop Graph hours . The BG correction range is shown as a blue bar on the glucose chart. Single-value target BG range (such as 100-100 mg/dl), will have a narrower blue range. When a temporary override range is enabled, a darker blue bar where the overrides are set will be displayed, as well as the normal correction target in lighter blue. The eventual BG displayed in the right side of the chart does NOT take into account a recently enacted temp basal. In other words, if you are above BG target and Loop just enacted a high temp basal to help, the eventual BG does not reflect the expected lowering of BGs that would result from that recently enacted temp basal. Loop waits until the insulin has actually been delivery before it \"uses\" the insulin in its calculations for BG impacts. If you suspended your pump or had a \"no delivery\" alarm shortly after the temp basal was started, you would want that accurately reflected in the insulin on board and associated eventual BG. If you tap on the Glucose Chart itself, it will open the Predicted Glucose chart described below. Predicted Glucose Chart \u2301 The predicted glucose view is a great way to gain insight into the various components\u2019 importance in Loop\u2019s prediction of eventual BG. The graph at the top of this view will match your Glucose Chart. Below this chart you will see a very detailed explanation of all of the variables that Loop takes into account in predicting your future BG value. Each of those effects (including Carbohydrates, Insulin, Glucose Momentum and Retrospective Correction) includes details of the calculation use. You can tap on any of the entries to turn them off and on for visualization. The resulting changes can be viewed by the changes in the dashed lines. Additionally, at the bottom of this screen there is a setting to Enable Retrospective Correction . By enabling it, it will more aggressively increase or decrease basal delivery when BG movement doesn\u2019t match the carbohydrates and insulin-based model. Most Loopers have found this setting to be quite useful and keep the slider on. Active Insulin Chart \u2301 The Active Insulin chart displays the total insulin contribution from both temp basals and boluses. Active IOB can be either positive and negative IOB. Negative IOB results from the suspension of normally scheduled basals. The active insulin displayed in the upper right corner of the chart does NOT include insulin contributions from a recently enacted temp basal or bolus until the pump\u2019s reservoir volume is read and confirms a drop in reservoir volume (confirming the insulin has actually been delivered). So long as you have Event History as the Preferred Data Source in Loop settings, primed insulin deliveries (e.g., cannula fills or manual primes) will not be counted towards IOB. Insulin Delivery Chart \u2301 The Insulin Delivery chart displays a history of the temp basals enacted by Loop. The display is relative to the scheduled basal rates entered in the Loop settings. So, a rate displayed in this chart as +0 units would indicate no temp basal was set, and Loop defaulted to the scheduled basal rate. Individual boluses are indicated by an orange triangle on the chart (shown in the graphic above, near the left-most time). The total insulin delivered since midnight, including all basals and boluses AND priming insulin , is given in the upper right corner of the graph. Please be patient for a bolus delivery to appear. There is a lag time from when you press the \u201cdeliver\u201d bolus button to when the orange triangle is drawn sometimes. The insulin has to be delivered and then the pump reservoir needs to be read to confirm delivery, before the triangle will appear and IOB will be added. Occassionally, the bolus may be temporarily rendered (drawn) as a very high temp basal rate vs. a (triangle) discrete bolus event. This does NOT mean that the Loop actually enacted a high temp basal rate...only that the bolus is being drawn on the chart in the equivalent of a high temp basal rate. Reservoir and Event History \u2301 Clicking on either the Active Insulin or Insulin Delivery charts will open your Insulin Delivery history. The top of the screen will display the current IOB and the total insulin delivered for the day since midnight (or since the time the loop became active if you started Loop after midnight). There are two viewing options; Reservoir or Event History. Loop\u2019s default is to use actual reservoir volumes for determining the insulin delivered. When there is a gap of 30 minutes or more in reservoir history, Loop classifies these readings as \u201cnot continuous\u201d and therefore unreliable for the purposes of determining insulin deliveries. Therefore in those instances, Loop will rely on the event histories to determine insulin deliveries during the non-continuous times. Carbohydrate Chart \u2301 The Carbohydrate chart displays the carbs used by Loop to predict BG changes. The active COB is displayed in the upper right corner of the chart. Clicking on the chart will open the Carb Entries history and you can edit/delete any previous entries through that screen. Please read the Carb Entries page for more information about editing carb entries. For more information about the Insulin Counteraction Effects information found in the Carb History, please see here (to do: insert link). Tool Bar \u2301 The tool bar is where your inputs to the Loop behavior take place. The individual components of the tool bar are, left to right: Carb entry tool - click on this tool to enter carbs into the Loop app. Loop will not read carb entries from the pump or Nightscout, so you must use the carb entry tool in Loop app in order to have carbs accounted for by the Loop. Detailed info regarding how to enter, save, and edit carb entries can be found in the Carb Entries page . Pre-meal target - click this tool to set the Pre-Meal temporary override target . This target will remain in effect (1) for 60 minutes, (2) until a carb entry is saved, or (3) until target is toggled off manually, whichever comes first. The background coloring of the Pre-Meal target will turn green when active and there will be a dark blue line on the BG chart indicating where the override target is enabled. For more information about use of the Pre-Meal target, see the Bolus Entries page . Bolus tool - click on this tool to bring up the bolus tool. Normally, this screen will automatically open on it's own and function as a bolus wizard when a meal is saved on the carb entry tool screen. The only time the bolus tool will not automatically open is if the amount of carbs saved is determined to be adequately covered by the insulin on board already. During rapidly rising BGs, where Loop doesn't have an adequate temp basal rate to cover the pace at which BGs are rising, you may try clicking on the bolus tool to see if Loop is recommending a correction bolus to help control the BG spike. For more information about the Bolus tool features and use, see the Bolus Entries page . Workout Target - click this tool to set the Workout temporary override target . This target will remain in effect for the duration you select. The standard duration selections available are 1 hour, 2 hour, or indefinitely. You can add or modify those options, before building the Loop app, by using the Workout mode customization option . For more information about using the Workout Mode, see here .

Every five minutes, triggered by new blood glucose data, it generates a new prediction. Both bolus recommendations and temporary basal rates are set based on this prediction. Terminology \u2301 This graph and legend illustrates terms commonly used in discussing Loop's algorithm, and shows them in the context of historical and forecasted blood glucose in a style similar to the status screen of Loop. Insulin activity duration The insulin activity duration is the duration of the insulin activity curve, and describes the point at which the delivered insulin dose no longer affects blood glucose. The insulin activity duration is 6 hours for Loop's rapid-acting and Fiasp insulin models. Correction range The correction range is the blood glucose range Loop uses to determine corrective actions (e.g., between 90 and 120 mg/dL in the figure). NOTE: Loop\u2019s correction range is a user setting and should not be confused with the target range, typically 70-180 mg/dL, used for the purpose of calculating the percent time in range. Correction minimum The lower or minimum value of the user\u2019s correction range, which is 90 mg/dL in the figure. Correction maximum The upper or maximum value of the user\u2019s correction range, which is 120 mg/dL in the figure. Correction target The correction target is the average value of the correction range. In the overview figure, this is 105 mg/dL given that the correction minimum is 90 mg/dL and the correction maximum is 120 mg/dL. Predicted blood glucose Loop makes a prediction of blood glucose values out for a length of time equal to your insulin action duration. The predicted blood glucose is the basis for how Loop makes its insulin delivery recommendations and actions. Eventual blood glucose The last value of the predicted glucose curve, in other words the very last blood glucose predicted at the end of your insulin action duration. In the figure above, this is 85 mg/dL. Minimum predicted blood glucose The lowest blood glucose value at any point in time within the prediction. In the figure above, this is 77 mg/dL.

Insulin activity duration The insulin activity duration is the duration of the insulin activity curve, and describes the point at which the delivered insulin dose no longer affects blood glucose. The insulin activity duration is 6 hours for Loop's rapid-acting and Fiasp insulin models. Correction range The correction range is the blood glucose range Loop uses to determine corrective actions (e.g., between 90 and 120 mg/dL in the figure). NOTE: Loop\u2019s correction range is a user setting and should not be confused with the target range, typically 70-180 mg/dL, used for the purpose of calculating the percent time in range. Correction minimum The lower or minimum value of the user\u2019s correction range, which is 90 mg/dL in the figure. Correction maximum The upper or maximum value of the user\u2019s correction range, which is 120 mg/dL in the figure.

You can see the individual contributions of these effects by tapping on the predicted blood glucose chart on Loop's status screen. Loop updates this blood glucose prediction every five minutes when a new CGM value has been received and the pump's status has been updated. Just a note, this whole section is fairly technical. While perhaps not the most interesting topic for many readers, if you are seeking the detailed view of the Loop algorithm this discussion is quite useful. If you want a more surface understanding, the overview and temporary basal recommendations sections alone are probably sufficient. Overview \u2301 Before we delve into each of the four individual effects, a general overview figure may be a helpful start. There are four effects summed together to produce Loop's final predicted blood glucose curve. Each individual effect, along with their combined effect, are illustrated in the figure below. Insulin, from boluses and temporary basals, will have a decreasing effect on the prediction. Carbohydrates will have an increasing effect on the prediction. Blood glucose momentum effect can have a positive or negative effect, depending on how blood glucose is trending in the most recent CGM values. As shown in the example below, blood glucose is trending slightly upwards at the time of the prediction. Therefore, the blood glucose momentum effect\u2019s contribution is pulling up the overall prediction from the other three effects for a short time. Retrospective correction is having a decreasing effect on the prediction, indicating that the recent rise in blood glucose was not as large as had been previously predicted by Loop in the recent past. The sections below provide detailed information on each of the four contributions. Insulin Effect \u2301 Most traditional pump users and caregivers are already familiar with the concept of an insulin activity curve, where the insulin\u2019s effect is time dependent. Insulin takes a little while to affect blood glucose. The insulin effect typically peaks around one hour after giving insulin and then gradually decays. Loop provides users with two different classes of insulin models (i.e., an exponential model and the Walsh model). All of the exponential models have an insulin activity duration of 6 hours, whereas the insulin activity duration is customizable for the Walsh model. The rapid-acting and Fiasp insulin activity curves are modeled as exponential curves that match the shape of the insulin activity curves from insulin labeling, and as observed in both adults and children. The amount of insulin effect remaining, or percent of remaining active insulin after an insulin bolus is delivered, is modeled mathematically in Loop with an exponential decay curve. Insulin Effect Remaining \u2301 If a user\u2019s insulin sensitivity factor (ISF) is 50 mg/dL per 1 unit of insulin and the user gives 2 units of insulin, then the user\u2019s blood glucose would be expected to drop 100 mg/dL within the 6 hours following the insulin delivery. This insulin effect can be visualized in several different ways: the expected active insulin, expected drop in blood glucose every 5 minutes after delivery, and expected cumulative drop in blood glucose. The figures below use the Rapid Acting - Adult insulin model in Loop. Active Insulin \u2301 This figure shows that 2 units of insulin are given initially, and the corresponding active insulin (i.e., insulin on board IOB) decays according to the curve below. The active insulin at any time is the product of original insulin delivered and the percent of insulin activity remaining. Knowing the expected active insulin over the next 6 hours, and the insulin sensitivity factor (50 mg/dL, in this case), Loop can calculate the expected drop in blood glucose from that dose of insulin as shown in the figure below. NOTE: ISF is also a function of time, which means if the user\u2019s scheduled ISF changes during the insulin activity time, it will change the expected drop in blood glucose due to the insulin effect. Expected Change in Blood Glucose \u2301 Lastly, taking the first derivative (i.e., the rate of change) of the cumulative drop in the blood glucose curve yields the expected change in blood glucose over the insulin activity duration. For each dose of insulin given, Loop calculates the expected discrete drop in blood glucose at each 5-minute period for the insulin activity duration, as shown below. Insulin Effect on Blood Glucose \u2301 For this example, assuming a user\u2019s blood glucose was 205 mg/dL at the time of insulin delivery, Loop would predict a drop in blood glucose due to the two units delivered at 12 pm as shown in the figure below. Scheduled Basal Rates \u2301 In traditional basal/bolus pump therapy, basal rates are set to accommodate the user's endogenous glucose production (EGP) that causes blood glucose to rise. If a user's basal settings were exactly right in traditional pump therapy, the user would have perfectly flat blood glucose all day, all other factors being equal. In reality, people with type 1 diabetes, and their caregivers, know that basal settings are never exactly right. Every day is a little different, and a myriad of factors that affect blood glucose (e.g., including stress, hormones, sleep, etc.) may affect insulin needs. Some people have different basal profiles to accommodate these variations. Some people regularly tune and adjust their basal rates, and/or do so at their endocrinology clinic visits. Since the Loop algorithm assumes that the user-set basal rates are reasonably correct, it calculates the effect of insulin relative to scheduled basal rates. If basal rates are not entirely correct, Loop can compensate a bit through the retrospective correction and blood glucose momentum effects, discussed later in this document. The insulin delivery chart below displays a bar-graph history of the temporary basal rates enacted by Loop. The display is relative to the scheduled basal rates entered in the Loop settings. A rate displayed in this chart as +0 would indicate that no temporary basal rate was set and that the basal rate being delivered was the scheduled basal rate. Positive values indicate a temporary basal rate was set above the scheduled basal rate (i.e., more insulin delivered), and negative values indicate that a temporary basal rate was set below the scheduled basal rate (i.e., less insulin delivered). For example, if the user\u2019s scheduled basal rate is 1 U/hr, and Loop gives a temporary basal rate of 3 U/hr, then it will calculate the expected drop in blood glucose due to +2 U/hr of insulin. Similarly if Loop sets a temporary basal rate of 0 U/hr for 1 hour, then the insulin effect will also be relative to the current scheduled basal rate of 1 U/hr, and Loop would predict the user\u2019s blood glucose to increase by the amount of change from -1 U/hr of insulin. If the user\u2019s ISF is 50 mg/dL, then Loop would predict blood glucose to rise 50 mg/dL over the insulin activity duration (6 hours). Here is a real-world example where Loop is setting many temporary basal rates over the the course of the day. The light orange bars are the temporary basal rates delivered and the solid orange line is the active insulin at any given time during the day. Total Insulin Effect (combining boluses and temporary basal rates) \u2301 Loop will combine or stack the active insulin of all the discrete (individual) boluses and temporary basal rates over the past insulin activity duration (6 hours), to predict the active insulin for the next 6 hours. As demonstrated above, using the predicted active insulin Loop can predict the blood glucose drop over the next 6 hours. Lastly, the combined effect of bolus and basal insulin are visually represented for the user by Loop\u2019s insulin charts: The insulin effect can be expressed mathematically: where BG is the expected change in blood glucose with the units (mg/dL/5min), ISF is the insulin sensitivity factor (mg/dL/U) at timet, and IA is the insulin activity (U/5min)at time t . Insulin activity can also be thought of as a velocity or rate of change in blood glucose due to insulin. The insulin activity accounts for the EGP and any active insulin from basals and boluses. Carbohydrate Effect \u2301 Carbohydrates will raise blood glucose, but the speed and degree to which they impact blood glucose is dependent on the type of carbohydrates. High glycemic index (GI) carbohydrates will raise blood glucose quickly over a shorter time, whereas low GI foods will raise blood glucose more slowly over a longer period. Foods like candy, juice, and fruits tend to be high GI foods, while pizza, burritos, and quesadillas are usually lower GI foods. Digestion issues like gastroparesis may also contribute to variations in carbohydrate absorption. Because carbohydrate absorption can be quite variable, Loop has a model that dynamically adjusts the expected remaining time of carbohydrate absorption. To start with, Loop allows the user to input a rough guess of how long they think the food or drink will take to absorb. The user\u2019s guess is used as a middle of the road estimate, and Loop\u2019s algorithm will shorten or lengthen it based on observed blood glucose change. For all carbohydrate entries, Loop assumes carbohydrates will not start absorbing for 10 minutes, so there is a 10-minute period of no absorption that is modeled prior to the absorption modeled in the next sections. Linear Carbohydrate Absorption \u2301 Loop takes a conservative view of how fast remaining carbohydrates will absorb. Because it is safer to under-deliver insulin for long duration meals, Loop starts out at a minimum rate of absorption based on extending the entered carbohydrate duration by 50%. Said another way, the minimum carbohydrate absorption rate is the total number of grams of carbohydrates over 150% of the entered duration. Using this initial minimum absorption rate, remaining carbohydrates are modeled to absorb linearly. For example, if the user enters a 72g carbohydrate meal, and selects an estimated absorption time of 4 hours, then Loop will forecast a 12g/hr absorption rate for the next 6 hours. This rate can be termed the minimum absorption rate, which can be represented mathematically as: where MAR is the minimum absorption rate (g/hr), CA is the amount of carbohydrates (g) and d is the expected duration (hr) it will take the carbohydrates to absorb. Dynamic Carbohydrate Absorption \u2301 The linear model above is modulated by an additional calculation that uses recent observed blood glucose data to estimate how fast carbohydrates have been absorbing. The expected change in blood glucose due to insulin effects alone is compared to the actual observed changes in blood glucose. This difference is termed the insulin counteraction effect (ICE): where, ICE (mg/dL/5 min) is the insulin counteraction effect, OA is the observed activity (mg/dL/5min) or observed change in blood glucose at time t , and IA is the insulin activity (mg/dL/5min). Insulin counteraction effects are caused by more than just carbohydrates, and can include exercise, sensitivity changes, or mis-set insulin delivery settings (e.g., basal rate, ISF, etc.). However, since the effect of carbohydrates is often dominant (after insulin), Loop can still make useful ongoing adjustments to its carbohydrate model by assuming that the an increase in blood glucose is mainly carbohydrate absorption in the period following recorded meal entries. The insulin counteraction effect is converted into an estimated carbohydrate absorption amount by using the current carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio and the insulin sensitivity factor at the time of the recorded meal entry. where AC is the amount of carbohydrates absorbed (g/5min), ICE is the insulin counteraction effect, CIR is the carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio (g/U), and ISF is the insulin sensitivity factor (mg/dL/U) at time t . If multiple meal entries are active (i.e., still absorbing), the estimated absorption is split between each carbohydrate entry in proportion to each carbohydrate entry\u2019s minimum absorption rate. For example, if 72g carbohydrates with an expected absorption time of 4 hours was consumed at 12 pm, and another 72g of carbohydrates with an expected absorption time of 2 hours was consumed at 3 pm, then the minimum absorption rate (see MAR equation above) would be 12 g/hr and 6 g/hr respectively, or 1 g/5min and 0.5 g/5min. Examining just the simple linear carbohydrate effect of these two meals: If we further expand this example, by assuming the following at 4pm: that there are still carbohydrates left to be absorbed from both meals, that the estimated insulin counteraction effect (ICE) is +15 , and the user\u2019s CIR is 10 g/U and the ISF is 50 mg/dL/U, then the estimated amount of carbohydrates absorbed at 4pm would be 3g: Those 3g of carbohydrates would then be split amongst the meals proportional to their minimum absorption rates: resulting in 2g of absorption being attributed to Meal 1 and 1g attributed to Meal 2. Minimum Carbohydrate Absorption Rate \u2301 If the estimated carbohydrate absorption of a meal entry is less what would have been absorbed using the minimum absorption rate, then the minimum absorption rate is used instead. This is to ensure that meal entries expire in a reasonable amount of time. Modeling Remaining Active Carbohydrates \u2301 After the estimated absorbed carbohydrates have been subtracted from each meal entry, the remaining carbohydrates (for each entry) are then forecasted to decay or absorb using the minimum absorption rate. Loop uses this forecast to estimate the effect (active carbohydrates, or carbohydrate activity) of the remaining carbohydrates. The carbohydrate effect can be expressed mathematically using the terms described above: Retrospective Correction Effect \u2301 The retrospective correction effect allows the Loop algorithm to account for effects that are not modeled with the insulin and carbohydrate effects, by comparing historical predictions to the actual blood glucose. In addition to the modeled effects of insulin and carbohydrates, there are many other factors that affect blood glucose (e.g., exercise, stress, hormones, etc.). Many of these effects are active for a period of time. By observing its own forecast error, Loop can estimate the magnitude of these effects and, by assuming that they will continue for some short period of time, incorporate them into the forecast to improve forecast accuracy. To do this, Loop calculates a retrospective forecast with a start time of 30 minutes in the past, ending at the current time. Loop compares the retrospective forecast to the actual observed change in blood glucose, and the difference is summed into a blood glucose velocity or rate of difference: where BG vel is a velocity term (mg/dL per 5min) that represents the average blood glucose difference between the retrospective forecast (RF) and the actual blood glucose (BG) over the last 30 minutes. This term is applied to the current forecast from the insulin and carb effects with a linear decay over the next hour. For example, the first forecast point (t=5) is approximately 100% of this velocity, the forecast point one half hour from now is adjusted by 50% of the velocity, and points from one hour or more in the future are not affected by this term. The retrospective correction effect can be expressed mathematically: where BG is the predicted change in blood glucose with the units (mg/dL/5min) at time t over the time range of 5 to 60 minutes, and the other term gives the percentage of BG vel that is applied to this effect. The retrospective correction effect can be illustrated with an example: if the BG vel over the past 30 minutes was -10 mg/dL per 5min, then the retrospective correction effect over the next 60 minutes would be as follows: Minutes relative to now ( t=0 ) Percent of BG vel Applied to RC Effect 5 100% -10 10 91% -9.1 15 82% -8.2 20 73% -7.3 25 64% -6.4 30 55% -5.5 35 45% -4.5 40 36% -3.6 45 27% -2.7 50 18% -1.8 55 9% -0.9 60 0% 0 Here\u2019s an example below that shows the retrospective correction effect when the BG vel over the past 30 minutes was -10mg/dL/5min. Blood Glucose Momentum Effect \u2301 The blood glucose momentum effect incorporates a prediction component based on the assumption that recent blood glucose trends tend to persist for a short period of time. In other words, the best predictor of the future is the recent past. The blood glucose momentum portion of the algorithm gives weight or importance to recent blood glucose to improve the near-future forecast. Loop calculates the slope of the last 3 continuous CGM readings (i.e., the last 15 minutes) using linear regression. Using multiple points helps filter out noise in the CGM data while still responding fast to changing situations. That momentum slope (Mslope) is the approximate or average rate of change over the last 15 minutes, though it is normalized to 5 minutes so that the units are (mg/dL/5min). The momentum slope is then blended into the next 20 minutes of predicted blood glucose from the other effects (i.e., insulin, carbohydrates, and retrospective correction effects). This, in essence, makes the next 20 minutes of blood glucose prediction more sensitive to recent blood glucose trends. The blending of the recent trend slope into the next 20 minutes is weighted so that the first prediction point (5 minutes into the future) is highly influenced by the slope, and the influence of the slope gradually decays over the 20 minute time period. The momentum effect can be expressed mathematically as: NOTE: The term is also applied to the combined insulin, carbohydrates, and retrospective correction effects to get the delta blood glucose prediction. The momentum effect can be illustrated with an example: if the last 3 blood glucose readings were 100, 103, and 106 mg/dL, then the slope would be 3 mg/dL per 5 minutes (0.6 mg/dL per minute). The amount of that recent trend or slope applied to the next 20 minutes of predictions (i.e., the next 4 predictions from the other effects) is roughly 100% (3 mg/dL per 5 min) at 5 minutes, 66% (2 mg/dL per 5 min) at 10 minutes, 33% (1 mg/dL per 5 min) at 15 minutes, and 0% (0 mg/dL per 5 min) at 20 minutes. Also, if the combined effect from the insulin, carbohydrates, and retrospective correction is assumed to be a constant 6 mg/dL/5min over the next 20 minutes, then the expected overall effect and the predicted blood glucose can be calculated as follows. Minutes relative to now ( t=0 ) Percent of Slope Applied to Momentum Effect Momentum Effect (3mg/dL/5min) Percent of Other Effects Applied Overall Effect Other Effects (Insulin, Carbohydrate, and Retrospective Correction) Overall Effect (mg/dL/5min) Predicted BG (mg/dL) 5 100% 3 0 6 3 109 10 66.6% 2 33.3% 6 4 113 15 33.3% 1 66.6% 6 5 118 20 0% 0 100% 6 6 124 This example is illustrated in the figure below. It is also worth noting that Loop will not calculate blood glucose momentum in instances where CGM data is not continuous (i.e., must have at least three continuous CGM readings to draw the best-fit straight line trend). It also will not calculate blood glucose momentum when the last three CGM readings contain any calibration points, as those may not be representative of true blood glucose momentum trends. Predicting Glucose \u2301 As described in the momentum effect section, the momentum effect is blended with the insulin, carbohydrate, and retrospective correction effects to predict the change in blood glucose: Lastly, the forecast or predicted blood glucose BG at time t is the current blood glucose BG plus the sum of all blood glucose effects BG over the time interval [t5, t]: Each individual effect along with the combined effects are illustrated in the figure below. As shown, blood glucose is trending slightly upwards at the time of the prediction. Therefore, the blood glucose momentum effect\u2019s contribution is pulling up the overall prediction from the other three effects for a short time. Retrospective correction is having a dampening effect on the prediction, indicating that the recent rise in blood glucose was not as great as had been previously predicted in the recent past.","title":"Glucose Prediction"},{"location":"operation/algorithm/prediction/#blood-glucose-prediction","text":"Loop uses an algorithm to maintain blood glucose in a correction range by predicting the contributions from four individual effects (insulin, carbohydrates, retrospective correction, and blood glucose momentum) at any time t to recommend temporary basal rate corrections and boluses.

For all carbohydrate entries, Loop assumes carbohydrates will not start absorbing for 10 minutes, so there is a 10-minute period of no absorption that is modeled prior to the absorption modeled in the next sections.","title":"Carbohydrate Effect"},{"location":"operation/algorithm/prediction/#linear-carbohydrate-absorption","text":"Loop takes a conservative view of how fast remaining carbohydrates will absorb. Because it is safer to under-deliver insulin for long duration meals, Loop starts out at a minimum rate of absorption based on extending the entered carbohydrate duration by 50%. Said another way, the minimum carbohydrate absorption rate is the total number of grams of carbohydrates over 150% of the entered duration. Using this initial minimum absorption rate, remaining carbohydrates are modeled to absorb linearly. For example, if the user enters a 72g carbohydrate meal, and selects an estimated absorption time of 4 hours, then Loop will forecast a 12g/hr absorption rate for the next 6 hours. This rate can be termed the minimum absorption rate, which can be represented mathematically as: where MAR is the minimum absorption rate (g/hr), CA is the amount of carbohydrates (g) and d is the expected duration (hr) it will take the carbohydrates to absorb.","title":"Linear Carbohydrate Absorption"},{"location":"operation/algorithm/prediction/#dynamic-carbohydrate-absorption","text":"The linear model above is modulated by an additional calculation that uses recent observed blood glucose data to estimate how fast carbohydrates have been absorbing. The expected change in blood glucose due to insulin effects alone is compared to the actual observed changes in blood glucose. This difference is termed the insulin counteraction effect (ICE): where, ICE (mg/dL/5 min) is the insulin counteraction effect, OA is the observed activity (mg/dL/5min) or observed change in blood glucose at time t , and IA is the insulin activity (mg/dL/5min). Insulin counteraction effects are caused by more than just carbohydrates, and can include exercise, sensitivity changes, or mis-set insulin delivery settings (e.g., basal rate, ISF, etc.). However, since the effect of carbohydrates is often dominant (after insulin), Loop can still make useful ongoing adjustments to its carbohydrate model by assuming that the an increase in blood glucose is mainly carbohydrate absorption in the period following recorded meal entries. The insulin counteraction effect is converted into an estimated carbohydrate absorption amount by using the current carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio and the insulin sensitivity factor at the time of the recorded meal entry. where AC is the amount of carbohydrates absorbed (g/5min), ICE is the insulin counteraction effect, CIR is the carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio (g/U), and ISF is the insulin sensitivity factor (mg/dL/U) at time t . If multiple meal entries are active (i.e., still absorbing), the estimated absorption is split between each carbohydrate entry in proportion to each carbohydrate entry\u2019s minimum absorption rate. For example, if 72g carbohydrates with an expected absorption time of 4 hours was consumed at 12 pm, and another 72g of carbohydrates with an expected absorption time of 2 hours was consumed at 3 pm, then the minimum absorption rate (see MAR equation above) would be 12 g/hr and 6 g/hr respectively, or 1 g/5min and 0.5 g/5min. Examining just the simple linear carbohydrate effect of these two meals: If we further expand this example, by assuming the following at 4pm: that there are still carbohydrates left to be absorbed from both meals, that the estimated insulin counteraction effect (ICE) is +15 , and the user\u2019s CIR is 10 g/U and the ISF is 50 mg/dL/U, then the estimated amount of carbohydrates absorbed at 4pm would be 3g: Those 3g of carbohydrates would then be split amongst the meals proportional to their minimum absorption rates: resulting in 2g of absorption being attributed to Meal 1 and 1g attributed to Meal 2.","title":"Dynamic Carbohydrate Absorption"},{"location":"operation/algorithm/prediction/#minimum-carbohydrate-absorption-rate","text":"If the estimated carbohydrate absorption of a meal entry is less what would have been absorbed using the minimum absorption rate, then the minimum absorption rate is used instead.

Loop uses this forecast to estimate the effect (active carbohydrates, or carbohydrate activity) of the remaining carbohydrates. The carbohydrate effect can be expressed mathematically using the terms described above:","title":"Modeling Remaining Active Carbohydrates"},{"location":"operation/algorithm/prediction/#retrospective-correction-effect","text":"The retrospective correction effect allows the Loop algorithm to account for effects that are not modeled with the insulin and carbohydrate effects, by comparing historical predictions to the actual blood glucose. In addition to the modeled effects of insulin and carbohydrates, there are many other factors that affect blood glucose (e.g., exercise, stress, hormones, etc.). Many of these effects are active for a period of time. By observing its own forecast error, Loop can estimate the magnitude of these effects and, by assuming that they will continue for some short period of time, incorporate them into the forecast to improve forecast accuracy. To do this, Loop calculates a retrospective forecast with a start time of 30 minutes in the past, ending at the current time. Loop compares the retrospective forecast to the actual observed change in blood glucose, and the difference is summed into a blood glucose velocity or rate of difference: where BG vel is a velocity term (mg/dL per 5min) that represents the average blood glucose difference between the retrospective forecast (RF) and the actual blood glucose (BG) over the last 30 minutes. This term is applied to the current forecast from the insulin and carb effects with a linear decay over the next hour. For example, the first forecast point (t=5) is approximately 100% of this velocity, the forecast point one half hour from now is adjusted by 50% of the velocity, and points from one hour or more in the future are not affected by this term. The retrospective correction effect can be expressed mathematically: where BG is the predicted change in blood glucose with the units (mg/dL/5min) at time t over the time range of 5 to 60 minutes, and the other term gives the percentage of BG vel that is applied to this effect. The retrospective correction effect can be illustrated with an example: if the BG vel over the past 30 minutes was -10 mg/dL per 5min, then the retrospective correction effect over the next 60 minutes would be as follows: Minutes relative to now ( t=0 ) Percent of BG vel Applied to RC Effect 5 100% -10 10 91% -9.1 15 82% -8.2 20 73% -7.3 25 64% -6.4 30 55% -5.5 35 45% -4.5 40 36% -3.6 45 27% -2.7 50 18% -1.8 55 9% -0.9 60 0% 0 Here\u2019s an example below that shows the retrospective correction effect when the BG vel over the past 30 minutes was -10mg/dL/5min.","title":"Retrospective Correction Effect"},{"location":"operation/algorithm/prediction/#blood-glucose-momentum-effect","text":"The blood glucose momentum effect incorporates a prediction component based on the assumption that recent blood glucose trends tend to persist for a short period of time. In other words, the best predictor of the future is the recent past. The blood glucose momentum portion of the algorithm gives weight or importance to recent blood glucose to improve the near-future forecast. Loop calculates the slope of the last 3 continuous CGM readings (i.e., the last 15 minutes) using linear regression. Using multiple points helps filter out noise in the CGM data while still responding fast to changing situations. That momentum slope (Mslope) is the approximate or average rate of change over the last 15 minutes, though it is normalized to 5 minutes so that the units are (mg/dL/5min). The momentum slope is then blended into the next 20 minutes of predicted blood glucose from the other effects (i.e., insulin, carbohydrates, and retrospective correction effects). This, in essence, makes the next 20 minutes of blood glucose prediction more sensitive to recent blood glucose trends. The blending of the recent trend slope into the next 20 minutes is weighted so that the first prediction point (5 minutes into the future) is highly influenced by the slope, and the influence of the slope gradually decays over the 20 minute time period. The momentum effect can be expressed mathematically as: NOTE: The term is also applied to the combined insulin, carbohydrates, and retrospective correction effects to get the delta blood glucose prediction. The momentum effect can be illustrated with an example: if the last 3 blood glucose readings were 100, 103, and 106 mg/dL, then the slope would be 3 mg/dL per 5 minutes (0.6 mg/dL per minute). The amount of that recent trend or slope applied to the next 20 minutes of predictions (i.e., the next 4 predictions from the other effects) is roughly 100% (3 mg/dL per 5 min) at 5 minutes, 66% (2 mg/dL per 5 min) at 10 minutes, 33% (1 mg/dL per 5 min) at 15 minutes, and 0% (0 mg/dL per 5 min) at 20 minutes. Also, if the combined effect from the insulin, carbohydrates, and retrospective correction is assumed to be a constant 6 mg/dL/5min over the next 20 minutes, then the expected overall effect and the predicted blood glucose can be calculated as follows. Minutes relative to now ( t=0 ) Percent of Slope Applied to Momentum Effect Momentum Effect (3mg/dL/5min) Percent of Other Effects Applied Overall Effect Other Effects (Insulin, Carbohydrate, and Retrospective Correction) Overall Effect (mg/dL/5min) Predicted BG (mg/dL) 5 100% 3 0 6 3 109 10 66.6% 2 33.3% 6 4 113 15 33.3% 1 66.6% 6 5 118 20 0% 0 100% 6 6 124 This example is illustrated in the figure below. It is also worth noting that Loop will not calculate blood glucose momentum in instances where CGM data is not continuous (i.e., must have at least three continuous CGM readings to draw the best-fit straight line trend). It also will not calculate blood glucose momentum when the last three CGM readings contain any calibration points, as those may not be representative of true blood glucose momentum trends.","title":"Blood Glucose Momentum Effect"},{"location":"operation/algorithm/prediction/#predicting-glucose","text":"As described in the momentum effect section, the momentum effect is blended with the insulin, carbohydrate, and retrospective correction effects to predict the change in blood glucose: Lastly, the forecast or predicted blood glucose BG at time t is the current blood glucose BG plus the sum of all blood glucose effects BG over the time interval [t5, t]: Each individual effect along with the combined effects are illustrated in the figure below. As shown, blood glucose is trending slightly upwards at the time of the prediction. Therefore, the blood glucose momentum effect\u2019s contribution is pulling up the overall prediction from the other three effects for a short time. Retrospective correction is having a dampening effect on the prediction, indicating that the recent rise in blood glucose was not as great as had been previously predicted in the recent past.","title":"Predicting Glucose"},{"location":"operation/algorithm/temp-basal/","text":"Basal Adjustments \u2301 The Loop algorithm takes one of four actions depending upon the eventual blood glucose, predicted glucose, and suspend threshold. Note that all temporary basal rate commands are issued for 30 minutes, however they may be updated (re-issued) every 5 minutes. Said another way, Loop may enact a new temporary basal rate every 5 minutes. But, if communication with the pump is lost, the last issued temporary basal rate will last for at most 30 minutes before the pump reverts to the user\u2019s scheduled basal rates. Note: If a user is operating Loop in open loop mode, the Loop will only recommend basal dosing actions and will not automatically enact those recommendations. Four Possbile Actions \u2301 Loop implements one of four possible basal actions: decrease , increase , suspend , or resume a scheduled basal rate. Decrease Basal Rate \u2301 If the eventual blood glucose is less than the correction range and all of the predicted glucose values are above the suspend threshold, then Loop will issue a temporary basal rate that is lower than the current scheduled basal rate to bring the eventual blood glucose up to the correction target. Increase Basal Rate \u2301 If the eventual blood glucose is greater than the correction range and all of the predicted glucose values are above the suspend threshold, then Loop will issue a temporary basal rate that is higher than the current basal rate to bring the eventual blood glucose down to the correction target. Suspend Basal Rate \u2301 If the minimum predicted blood glucose goes below the suspend threshold, then Loop will issue a temporary basal rate of zero units per hour, regardless of the eventual blood glucose. Resume Basal Rate \u2301 There are three situations where the Loop algorithm will resume the current scheduled basal rate. If the eventual blood glucose is within the correction range, and all of the predicted glucose values are above the suspend threshold, then Loop will resume the current scheduled basal rate. If the eventual blood glucose is above the correction range, and the predicted glucose values have a temporary excursion below the correction range but still above the suspend threshold, then Loop will resume the current scheduled basal rate. If the Loop algorithm does not have ALL of the data it needs to make a prediction, it will let the remaining temporary basal rate run its duration (maximum of 30 minutes), and then the basal rate will default back to the current scheduled basal rate, thus returning to the same therapy pattern that they would receive using a traditional insulin pump. Determining the Temporary Basal Rate \u2301 To determine the corrective temporary basal rate to implement, Loop calculates a \u201cdose\u201d in the same way doses are calculated in both open loop and traditional insulin pump therapy. It's also the same math many people on multiple-daily injection therapy use. The benefit of Loop (and all other closed loop algorithms) is that it does this math every 5 minutes, and is far less prone to error than humans doing math. Loop also does its math based on predicting into the future, which traditional pumps and humans, do not always have the time or inclination to do. The amount of insulin needed, or dose, is calculated using the desired reduction in blood glucose and the user\u2019s ISF. For the Loop algorithm, the desired reduction in blood glucose is the delta between the eventual blood glucose and the correction target: A major difference between traditional pump therapy and how the Loop calculates dose is that in pump therapy the current blood glucose is used to estimate the dose, whereas in the Loop algorithm the eventual and minimum blood glucose predictions are also used in determining dosing decisions. Loop then converts the dose into a basal rate using the Loop\u2019s temporary basal rate duration of 30 minutes: where BR is the basal rate (U/hr), which is the amount of insulin needed over the next 30 minutes to bring the eventual blood glucose to the correction target. The basal rate, however, is the amount of basal rate needed beyond the user\u2019s scheduled basal rate. As such, the required basal rate can be determined by: where RBR is the required basal rate and SBR is the scheduled basal rate. Finally, Loop compares the RBR with the user-specified maximum temporary basal rate setting to determine the temporary basal to issue: If RBR \u2265 maximum basal rate, then Loop will issue the maximum basal rate If RBR < maximum temporary basal rate, then Loop will issue RBR After running the temporary basal calculation described above, Loop checks whether there is already an appropriate basal running with at least 10 minutes remaining. If so, Loop will not reissue the temporary basal. However, if the recommended temporary basal differs from the currently running temporary basal \u2014 or the current scheduled basal if no temporary is running \u2014 then Loop will replace the current basal rate with the recommended temporary basal rate. As mentioned at the beginning of this section, the process of determining whether a temporary basal should be issued is repeated every 5 minutes. Temporary Basal Rate Calculation Example \u2301 To illustrate how the Loop calculates the temporary basal rate to issue, consider the calculation for the following scenario: Eventual blood glucose = 200 mg/dL Correction target = 100 mg/dL ISF = 50 mg/dL/U Current scheduled basal rate (SBR) is 1 U/hr Maximum basal setting (set by user in Loop) = 6 U/hr First, calculate the dose: Then, convert the dose into a basal rate to be issued for the next 30 minutes: Next, calculate the required basal rate: Lastly, compare the required basal rate to the maximum temporary basal rate, and find that Loop will enact a temporary basal rate of 5 U/hr for 30 minutes since this temporary basal rate is below the maximum temporary basal rate of 6 U/hr, which was set by the user in Loop app settings.","title":"Temp Basal Adjustments"},{"location":"operation/algorithm/temp-basal/#basal-adjustments","text":"The Loop algorithm takes one of four actions depending upon the eventual blood glucose, predicted glucose, and suspend threshold.

Discharge Curves \u2301 There are generally two different types of AAA batteries that we use in these Medtronic pumps; alkaline or lithium. To understand pump battery levels, you first need to know a little about battery discharge curves . It's not a hard concept...basically how a battery dies over time as it is used or sits in a drawer. More technically said, a battery discharge curve is the measure of volts that a battery puts out over time. Batteries start at a higher voltage output and slowly that volatge output degrades over time (or use) until the battery no longer provides enough \"ummph\" to keep the electronic gadget going. BUT, alkaline batteries and lithium batteries have different discharge curves due to the chemistry inside them, and the curves can be slightly different depending on environment (temperature) and battery manufacturer. Alkaline batteries have a relatively steady voltage drop over time, as shown below. Notice the shape of the curve has a significant amount of time in the 1.3 to 1.2 volts range, and a relatively smooth decline to about 1.2 volts. Lithium batteries have a much steadier voltage output over time, as shown below. Notice how the shape of the curve is relatively flat for a large portion of the battery life before suddenly off around 1.3 volts. What does the above information mean in terms of Looping? A lithium battery at 1.3v is going to have a much quicker time to death than an alkaline battery sitting at 1.3v. You might only get a couple hours of looping left when a lithium battery is at 1.3v, but a alkaline battery at 1.3v might go another several days. So when we talk about setting alarm levels in either system, your battery type is an important consideration. Medtronic Pump Battery Level Indicator \u2301 If you read Medtronic's literature, it will tell you to use Energizer alkaline batteries in their pumps. Why would that be? Hint: the answer doesn't mean that Duracell batteries are inherently worse than Energizer or that lithium batteries won't work in Medtronic pumps. The answer is all about the accuracy of their little pump battery level indicator on their pump's screen. Medtronic calibrated their pump battery level indicator to: Energizer alkaline batteries Normal (non-Loop) uses Temperatures between 37\u00b0F (3\u00b0C) to 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C). In other words, Medtronic ran experiments to see exactly how long an Energizer alkaline battery will last in normal pump use and made their own discharge curve. They programmed their pump battery level indicator to change from 4 bars to 3 bars to 2 bars to 1 bar based on that particular discharge curve. However, Loop users are slightly more demanding on the pump's battery/voltage than simply having the insulin delivery. We are also asking for the pump to perform radio communications, in addition to delivering insulin. That radio communications needs a slightly higher voltage than the typical \"normal\" pump use. So while a non-Looper might be ok running their pump until a voltage of about 1.12 for insulin delivery, radio communications might stop at a voltage output of about 1.17. If you experiment with your Looping pump, you'll find Loop will turn red from failed pump comms before the pump actually fails at insulin delivery. This difference between \"failure\" voltages needs to be considered when determining how much useful battery life is left for a pump battery. In summary, that little pump battery indicator on the Medtronic pump screen is ONLY useful if you are: not using the pump for Looping, using Energizer alkaline batteries, and in the temperature environment similar to their testing. Loop users should not rely on their Medtronic pump screen's pump battery indicator, and instead use the Loop's pump battery level indicator. Loop's Pump Battery Level Indicator \u2301 Keeping the information about battery discharge curves in mind, Loop developers tested various battery brands and types to develop discharge curves for Loop users. These discharge curves form the basis of the pump battery level indicator found in the top right of the Loop's main display screen and the pump battery notifications provided by the Loop app. The pump battery level indicator will also report in %. For x23 and x54 model users, the Loop's pump battery level will move in 25% increments. For x15 and x22 model users, the Loop's pump battery level will move in discrete % increments. Using information of the battery type selected and the pump model being used, the Loop's pump battery level notifications are designed to give the user about 8 hours of notice before pump communications are likely to fail. The Loop user should have some additional time after pump comms fail before actual insulin delivery would stop. Nightscout Pump Battery Display \u2301 The Nightscout information regarding pump battery levels will depend on pump model being used. If you use an x23 or x54 pump and MySentry, the pump levels are reported as percent to NS, because that's how MySentry reports the data to Loop. The packets use 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% increments, and the Loop's main display matches the NS pump display. If you use an x22 or x15 pump, the pump levels are reported as voltage readings to NS because Loop has to specifically ask the pump for its voltage reading. The Loop's main display will show pump battery level as discrete %, not the individual voltage measurement. No matter what pump you are using, you can always get a the current pump battery's voltage by using the RileyLink's Read Pump Status command. The extra communications effort for non-MySentry model pumps will mean slightly shorter battery life vs. MySentry model pumps. Nightscout Pump Battery Alarms \u2301 The Nightscout alarms are based on the Heroku settings that you have input specifically. If you don't specifically set them, Nightscout will use the default settings for pump battery alerts as shown below: Nightscout pump battery levels, if you leave things at default installation, will not trigger alarms. If however you add an setting of PUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS to true , you will receive pump battery notifications according to the levels shown in the parenthesis above. For example, your x23 pump is reporting its levels in percent, therefore you'd receive a warning yellow alarm at 30% and an urgent red alarm at 20%. Your x22 pump however is reporting its levels at voltage readings, therefore you'd receive a warning yellow alarm at 1.35v and an urgent red alarm at 1.30v. Are the default NS alarm levels going to work for you? The answer depends on what type of battery level you are using, what model pump you are using, and how much advance notification you want to receive before needing to change a pump battery. There is a bit of personal preference and experimentation to finding what works for you. For x22 or x15 pump users, the NS alert settings that may need to be adjusted are the ones based on voltage. Generally speaking, for a x22 or x15 pump using alkaline batteries, the default NS alarm levels will be too early to be useful and lead you to changing out your battery too frequently. Alkaline batteries can go to low 1.2s or high 1.1s before Looping starts to have communication problems. How much lower than the default voltage 1.35/1.30 alarm levels you want to go will depend on how far in advance you want to be warned about an upcoming battery change. If however, you are using a x22 or x15 pump with lithium batteries, the default 1.35v/1.30v alarm levels may be completely appropriate. Remember how the lithium battery curves at the start of this discussion died off quickly around 1.3v? You won't get hardly any heads-up notice for a lithium battery if you set the alarm below 1.3v. For x23 or x54 pump users, the NS alert settings that may need to be adjusted are the ones based on percentage settings. Alkaline and lithium batteries should have automatically had their percentage-remaining based on the correct battery type in your Loop settings. So, generally speaking the default NS alert levels don't generally need adjusting. However, if you are using lithium batteries, the drop off between 75% to 25% can be quite dramatic and not be easy to anticipate (especially if the drop happens overnight). As an alternate method of tracking pump battery changes, you could use the insulin age (IAGE) plug-in to anticipate your pump battery changes as well. For example, after tracking pump battery life on my 723 using energizer batteries lithium batteries for the last several months, I know that we get about 15 days plus a handful of hours. The amount of hours more beyond 15 days varies depending on how much we've interacted with the pump buttons directly, whether we've looped the full 15 days solid, and if the pump has been in extreme weather (cold weather can sap pump battery life). By tracking the pump battery changes with NS's careportal \"insulin cartridge change\", I can see in advance if we are nearing an overnight on a 15 day battery and decide to change batteries before overnight to prevent any middle-of-night battery issues. Lithium batteries will get signifcantly longer life than an alkaline battery. Experiment and track your particular pump model and battery type to understand what NS settings will work best for you. Do not rely on the pump's on-screen pump battery indicator, especially when using lithium batteries.","title":"Pump Battery"},{"location":"operation/features/battery/#pump-battery","text":"One common confusion point for new Loop users is how to interpret their pump's battery levels and whether they need to change their pump batteries based on which pieces of information.","title":"Pump Battery"},{"location":"operation/features/battery/#discharge-curves","text":"There are generally two different types of AAA batteries that we use in these Medtronic pumps; alkaline or lithium.

A lithium battery at 1.3v is going to have a much quicker time to death than an alkaline battery sitting at 1.3v. You might only get a couple hours of looping left when a lithium battery is at 1.3v, but a alkaline battery at 1.3v might go another several days. So when we talk about setting alarm levels in either system, your battery type is an important consideration.","title":"Discharge Curves"},{"location":"operation/features/battery/#medtronic-pump-battery-level-indicator","text":"If you read Medtronic's literature, it will tell you to use Energizer alkaline batteries in their pumps. Why would that be? Hint: the answer doesn't mean that Duracell batteries are inherently worse than Energizer or that lithium batteries won't work in Medtronic pumps. The answer is all about the accuracy of their little pump battery level indicator on their pump's screen. Medtronic calibrated their pump battery level indicator to: Energizer alkaline batteries Normal (non-Loop) uses Temperatures between 37\u00b0F (3\u00b0C) to 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C). In other words, Medtronic ran experiments to see exactly how long an Energizer alkaline battery will last in normal pump use and made their own discharge curve. They programmed their pump battery level indicator to change from 4 bars to 3 bars to 2 bars to 1 bar based on that particular discharge curve. However, Loop users are slightly more demanding on the pump's battery/voltage than simply having the insulin delivery. We are also asking for the pump to perform radio communications, in addition to delivering insulin. That radio communications needs a slightly higher voltage than the typical \"normal\" pump use. So while a non-Looper might be ok running their pump until a voltage of about 1.12 for insulin delivery, radio communications might stop at a voltage output of about 1.17. If you experiment with your Looping pump, you'll find Loop will turn red from failed pump comms before the pump actually fails at insulin delivery. This difference between \"failure\" voltages needs to be considered when determining how much useful battery life is left for a pump battery. In summary, that little pump battery indicator on the Medtronic pump screen is ONLY useful if you are: not using the pump for Looping, using Energizer alkaline batteries, and in the temperature environment similar to their testing. Loop users should not rely on their Medtronic pump screen's pump battery indicator, and instead use the Loop's pump battery level indicator.","title":"Medtronic Pump Battery Level Indicator"},{"location":"operation/features/battery/#loops-pump-battery-level-indicator","text":"Keeping the information about battery discharge curves in mind, Loop developers tested various battery brands and types to develop discharge curves for Loop users. These discharge curves form the basis of the pump battery level indicator found in the top right of the Loop's main display screen and the pump battery notifications provided by the Loop app. The pump battery level indicator will also report in %. For x23 and x54 model users, the Loop's pump battery level will move in 25% increments. For x15 and x22 model users, the Loop's pump battery level will move in discrete % increments. Using information of the battery type selected and the pump model being used, the Loop's pump battery level notifications are designed to give the user about 8 hours of notice before pump communications are likely to fail. The Loop user should have some additional time after pump comms fail before actual insulin delivery would stop.","title":"Loop's Pump Battery Level Indicator"},{"location":"operation/features/battery/#nightscout-pump-battery-display","text":"The Nightscout information regarding pump battery levels will depend on pump model being used. If you use an x23 or x54 pump and MySentry, the pump levels are reported as percent to NS, because that's how MySentry reports the data to Loop. The packets use 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% increments, and the Loop's main display matches the NS pump display. If you use an x22 or x15 pump, the pump levels are reported as voltage readings to NS because Loop has to specifically ask the pump for its voltage reading. The Loop's main display will show pump battery level as discrete %, not the individual voltage measurement. No matter what pump you are using, you can always get a the current pump battery's voltage by using the RileyLink's Read Pump Status command. The extra communications effort for non-MySentry model pumps will mean slightly shorter battery life vs. MySentry model pumps.","title":"Nightscout Pump Battery Display"},{"location":"operation/features/battery/#nightscout-pump-battery-alarms","text":"The Nightscout alarms are based on the Heroku settings that you have input specifically. If you don't specifically set them, Nightscout will use the default settings for pump battery alerts as shown below: Nightscout pump battery levels, if you leave things at default installation, will not trigger alarms. If however you add an setting of PUMP_ENABLE_ALERTS to true , you will receive pump battery notifications according to the levels shown in the parenthesis above. For example, your x23 pump is reporting its levels in percent, therefore you'd receive a warning yellow alarm at 30% and an urgent red alarm at 20%. Your x22 pump however is reporting its levels at voltage readings, therefore you'd receive a warning yellow alarm at 1.35v and an urgent red alarm at 1.30v. Are the default NS alarm levels going to work for you? The answer depends on what type of battery level you are using, what model pump you are using, and how much advance notification you want to receive before needing to change a pump battery. There is a bit of personal preference and experimentation to finding what works for you. For x22 or x15 pump users, the NS alert settings that may need to be adjusted are the ones based on voltage. Generally speaking, for a x22 or x15 pump using alkaline batteries, the default NS alarm levels will be too early to be useful and lead you to changing out your battery too frequently. Alkaline batteries can go to low 1.2s or high 1.1s before Looping starts to have communication problems. How much lower than the default voltage 1.35/1.30 alarm levels you want to go will depend on how far in advance you want to be warned about an upcoming battery change. If however, you are using a x22 or x15 pump with lithium batteries, the default 1.35v/1.30v alarm levels may be completely appropriate. Remember how the lithium battery curves at the start of this discussion died off quickly around 1.3v? You won't get hardly any heads-up notice for a lithium battery if you set the alarm below 1.3v. For x23 or x54 pump users, the NS alert settings that may need to be adjusted are the ones based on percentage settings. Alkaline and lithium batteries should have automatically had their percentage-remaining based on the correct battery type in your Loop settings. So, generally speaking the default NS alert levels don't generally need adjusting. However, if you are using lithium batteries, the drop off between 75% to 25% can be quite dramatic and not be easy to anticipate (especially if the drop happens overnight). As an alternate method of tracking pump battery changes, you could use the insulin age (IAGE) plug-in to anticipate your pump battery changes as well. For example, after tracking pump battery life on my 723 using energizer batteries lithium batteries for the last several months, I know that we get about 15 days plus a handful of hours. The amount of hours more beyond 15 days varies depending on how much we've interacted with the pump buttons directly, whether we've looped the full 15 days solid, and if the pump has been in extreme weather (cold weather can sap pump battery life). By tracking the pump battery changes with NS's careportal \"insulin cartridge change\", I can see in advance if we are nearing an overnight on a 15 day battery and decide to change batteries before overnight to prevent any middle-of-night battery issues. Lithium batteries will get signifcantly longer life than an alkaline battery. Experiment and track your particular pump model and battery type to understand what NS settings will work best for you. Do not rely on the pump's on-screen pump battery indicator, especially when using lithium batteries.","title":"Nightscout Pump Battery Alarms"},{"location":"operation/features/bolus/","text":"Bolus \u2301 Bolus entries can be made manually through the bolus tool (double orange triangles) in the toolbar, either as part of a meal bolus or as a correction for a high BG. Meal Bolus \u2301 Loop has a Bolus Wizard, similar to a pump\u2019s bolus wizard. After a carb entry is saved, Loop will provide a bolus screen with a recommended bolus amount. The only time the bolus screen wouldn't appear is if Loop believes the insulin-on-board is already sufficient to cover the added carbs. If you want to deliver the total amount of the recommended bolus, simply tap on the recommended amount of units and the bolus delivery line will automatically be filled-in with the same units. If you want to give fewer units than the recommended amount, you can manually enter the desired amount to be delivered. The Bolus Wizard will not offer a recommended bolus if your BG is predicted to go below your specified Suspend Threshold. A screen will appear letting you know the reason no bolus is being recommended as well as the status of your active COB and IOB. You can choose to override that warning and give a bolus, or treat the low BG and come back to the bolus tool when your BG has recovered. Correction Bolus \u2301 Occasionally, a recommended bolus will be offered in the bolus tool unrelated to a newly saved carb entry. In those cases, Loop is calculating that it will not be able to stay in the BG correction range through the use of high temp basals alone and is offering a \u201ccorrection bolus\u201d. Correction boluses will not be delivered automatically by Loop, they must be delivered by the user. Loop will also not give an alert when a correction bolus is being offered, the bolus entry tool must be clicked to check for one. The Loop pill in Nightscout will also display when Loop has a recommended bolus calculated. In a well-tuned loop with decent carb counting, correction boluses should be infrequently needed. Part of Loop's predictions for future BG changes include a component called BG momentum. Loop does not use BG momentum component of predicted BGs for bolusing recommendations. The omission of BG momentum from bolus recommendations helps Loop not over-correct when bolusing during times of rapidly increasing BGs. Starting Bolus Notification \u2301 A new status line will appear when Loop is sending a bolus command to the pump. Just above the Glucose Chart, you will see a \"starting bolus\" indicator. Bolus Failure Notifications \u2301 On occasion, you will receive notification that a bolus may have failed. In some of these cases, the bolus actually will begin delivery. Therefore, you should always check the pump screen to verify the bolus status before attempting to redeliver a failed bolus. There is a known issue with some x15 WW pumps falsely stating bolus failure notifications with every bolus. Please read here for additional information about how to fix the issue until Loop code is updated with a permanent fix. Pre-Meal \u2301 The pre-meal override target can be used prior to bolusing in order to help control post-prandial BGs. For example, by setting an 80 mg/dl - 80 mg/dl pre-meal target an hour before a meal, Loop to deliver additional insulin to bring BGs down to 80 mg/dL instead of the usual correction range. By getting the insulin in a little sooner, there will be more active insulin awaiting the carb absoprtion when the meal is eaten. If you are using the pre-meal target, when you save the carbs for the meal entry, Loop will cancel the pre-meal target and revert back to your normal correction range. The Loop will account for the amount of insulin it has prebolused and use your normal correction range when making the bolus recommendation. Square or Dual Waves \u2301 Unfortunately, Loop cannot enact temp basals while the pump is delivering a square- or dual-wave bolus. Therefore, you will need to use alternate bolusing strategies for situation where you would've previously used those extended bolusing techniques. The good news is that Loop has the only \"smart\" bolus wizard available in any DIY or commercial loop. Because you are entering a carb absorption time with each carb entry, Loop is also using that information to predict how well your insulin bolusing and carb absorption will align. So when Loop offers you a bolus, it may actually offer less of a bolus upfront for long, slow carb meals...and will make up the remaining bolus amount via high temp basals later. In understanding Loop's smart bolusing, it may help to think back to the reason you originally used square- or dual-wave boluses. Typically you used those extended bolusing strategies because if you had entered all the insulin, based on carb ratio alone, upfront at the beginning of the meal...you would have gone low shortly after bolusing. The food would simply be absorbing too slow and the whole amount of insulin working too fast...and you'd go low until the rest of the meal would kick in later. The extended bolusing was a way of avoiding the early low and also addressing the later high for meals like pizza or chinese food. Loop emmulates that extended bolusing when you enter long duration carb absorptions. Let's use an example of a pizza meal where carb ratios alone would've required a 10 unit bolus for the meal. By telling Loop the meal will take a long (aka 4+ hours) carb absorption time, Loop may only offer 6 units up front as an initial bolus. After you eat though, Loop knows that it has not provided all the insulin that will be necessary to account for the carbs. Loop will provide the remaining 4 units via high temp basals as soon as predicted BGs are showing that there is no danger of a post-prandial low. In other words, Loop waits until the danger of a quick low is over and then will high temp to cover the late digesting carbs. If you don't want to wait for Loop to deliver the remaining \"second\" bolus via high temps, you can click on the bolus tool when BGs start to rise and deliver the remaining bolus needed. Loop will have a recommended bolus awaiting when the predicted BGs are above correction range. While you adapt to new bolusing techniques, it is important to monitor closely to see what works for you. It will take some trial and error to get it right. For meals like Chinese food, where there is a mix of fast carbs and slow carbs, you may want to break the total meal entry into a couple mixed carb entries to help Loop provide the best bolus recommendation upfront. Additionally, some people account for the fats/proteins that digest by adding slow carbs with long absorption times for meals that cause late BG rises. A very useful tool is to check back on your Insulin Counteraction Effects graph to see how your original entry compared to how Loop perceived your final meal impacts. You can read more about that tool here (to do: insert link). Glucodyn \u2301 Using the Glucodyn model can help you simulate new bolusing strategies. Glucodyn allows you to simulate your post-prandial BGs based on your particular ISF, carb ratio, and carbs. You can simulate split boluses and watch their impact on simulated BG responses. The underlying math of the Glucodyn model was the basis of Loop's insulin/carb calculations in early Loop versions. The math has changed since then, however the model still provides a useful visualization about the interactions between DIA, carb absorption times and insulin dosing.","title":"Bolus"},{"location":"operation/features/bolus/#bolus","text":"Bolus entries can be made manually through the bolus tool (double orange triangles) in the toolbar, either as part of a meal bolus or as a correction for a high BG.","title":"Bolus"},{"location":"operation/features/bolus/#meal-bolus","text":"Loop has a Bolus Wizard, similar to a pump\u2019s bolus wizard.

Now your entry serves more as a guideline, than a rule, for Loop to model carb absorption. For a more detailed explanation of the new dynamic carb absorption model, please read about it here . To help Loop adjust for carbs that may digest slower than your original estimate, Loop will initially apply a 1.5x multiplier to your entered carb absorption time. So, a meal entered using the taco icon will initially be treated as a 4.5 hour absorption meal. As Loop observes the BG impacts of the meal, Loop will shorten the meal's absorption time if BGs are showing quicker impacts than expected, as well as adjust insulin deliveries (e.g., increase temp basals).

When you have entered your last carb entry for the meal, then use the bolus tool to deliver the bolus for the entire meal. Loop will provide a recommendation based on all the saved carbs and their respective absorption durations in total. Prebolus \u2301 You can let Loop know you are going to prebolus a meal by adjusting the time of the carb entry on the \u201cdate\u201d line of the carb entry. If you are prebolusing by 20 minutes, simply add 20 minutes to the carb entry time. Edit Carbs \u2301 Clicking on the Carbohydrate chart in the Loop's main status screen will open the carb entry history and previous entries can be modified or deleted through this screen. If you need to change a prebolus time, add/subtract carbs, adjust carb absorption times (even mid-meal), just go into that edit screen and tap on the carb entry you'd like to edit, or left-swipe to delete the entry entirely. This can be a particularly useful tool when: You did not finish an entire meal that you bolused for, You did not get to eat meal at the time you originally expected, You ate more servings than originally entered, or You suspect your carb count was in error because BGs are rising more/less than expected. Third Party Apps \u2301 If you use a 3rd party app, such as My Fitness Pal, to enter and track carbs and that app also stores the carb values in HealthKit, Loop will read those values from Apple HealthKit and display and use them in calculating temp basal rates. Entries from 3rd party apps can not be removed from within Loop. You will have to edit them in the third party app, or from the Health app. Because of this potential for confusion, it is recommended to turn off Loop's ability to read other apps' carbohydrate data from HealthKit.

Loop is calling that upward pressure Insulin Counteraction Effect (ICE). This is a pretty reasonable assumption so let's use that for the rest of this discussion. ICE display \u2301 Let's take a look at an example day using the screenshot below. The graph at the top of your ICE page represents that upward pressure Loop expects from the food entries.

Loop will be updating that value of \"observed\" carb absorption time as well as absorbed carbs as your meal goes on. Practical use \u2301 So how can we use this information to make our Looping experience better? The answer is probably best illustrated using a real world example. Chinese food...in fact, THIS chinese dish. General Tso's chicken. As you can see in the recipe, loads of fast carbs with ingredients like hoisin sauce, brown sugar, and cornstarch. But also slower carbs like chicken. Rice can be a difficult one because for us, it acts fast but also seems to have a long tail. It was a busy day and I really didn't want to count carbs. Ok, even on the slow days I don't want to count carbs. I just eyeballed the bowl of food and guessed. As I entered the food in originally, I was still trying to come up with a good guess on the ratio of fast:slow carbs but kid was in a hurry to eat. My initial guess around 3:30pm was 70g of carbs at 5 hours absorption (note: it gets edited to 80g in a little bit), we bolused for that and she started to eat. About 10 minutes later, I decided to add 10g of fast acting carbs at 1 hour absorption to help with the sauce's speedy carbs. Watching what was going on a little later...BGs were rising at a decent clip and I had a feeling I really didn't cover things super well...so I edited the original 70g entry, adding 10g and making it 80g instead. (That's why there is a 2U bolus around 4:20pm.) And of course around 5:40pm there was a little bit of nibbling on the leftovers as we put them into the fridge. We gave 10g for that. BGs climbed a bit more, not suprising given how we were underestimating fast carbs at this point...but still not so bad at 180 peak BG. (Anna gave 2 units correction at the peak because there was dessert coming later that night and she wanted to be ready for it without too much prebolus.) So, how can I use the ICE info to make this meal better? I can look at the observed ICE information and the observed carb entry Loop has recorded to adjust my insulin bolusing the next time we eat this meal. For example, the biggest weakness I had in this (and suspected it even as I did the initial bolus) was that I underestimated the sauce's fast carbs. I can see this in the observed ICE graph having the early green peaks after the meal, and in the way that the observed carb distribution was more like 7:2 vs my original guess of 8:1 (slow:fast carbs). Overall looks like I guess on overall carb content pretty close (90g vs. 89g observed). Next time we have General Tso's chicken, I will likely bolus it as 70g at 5 hours and 20g at 2 hours. So remember to check your ICE page at the end of a meal's absorption. By checking in on the meal's observed behaviors, you'll have a good starting point to fine-tuning any new or unknown carb breakdown. Side note: remember this conversation is assuming you have basals fairly well set and are not sick. If other factors could be significantly causing your BGs to swing that Loop doesn't know about (bad sites, illness, or basal rates that need to be adjusted), they may be attributed to ICE when they really aren't food related.

There are several ways you can help make that transition as smooth as possible. Timing \u2301 Many people choose to transition to close loop in a step-wise fashion. Starting close loop on weekends is an easier starting point so that you can minimize distractions (let's face it...you'll probably be staring at the Loop a lot for those first few days). Typically, people have an easier time transitioning to close loop for parts of their day that don't involve food...so nighttimes tend to be easier than daytimes to start. Maximum Basal Rate \u2301 When you are first beginning to close loop, it is important to be conservative (low) in setting your maximum basal rate.

Gradually increase your maximum basal rate as your comfort and confidence in Loop increase. Typically, experienced closed loop users set their max basal rate no more than 3-4 times their average basal rate. BG targets \u2301 If your basals, ISF, or carb ratios aren't set correctly, Loop may overshoot and leave you lower than expected (or with more IOB than you are comfortable with). Setting your low BG target slightly higher can help prevent unexpected lows or high IOB as you adjust your settings.

Meals \u2301 Meals will likely be the hardest part of transitioning to close loop. Starting with foods that you have a high comfort level with is a great idea. If you have favorite meals that you know well (how high BGs usually go, how much to bolus, how to prebolus, etc), these would be a good starting point.

Test, observe, and adjust as needed.","title":"Meals"},{"location":"operation/loop/open-loop/","text":"Open Loop \u2301 Open loop is a great place to start with Loop. When you are operating in open loop mode, Loop is offering recommedendations for temp basals and will display them on the main screen. The recommendations will not be enacted unless you specifically choose to enact the temp basal. Usually in open loop mode, you aren't really enacting the recommended basals but instead watching how the recommendations come in and figuring out WHY they are being recommended. It is understandable to want to jump straight away into close loop mode, but a lot can be learned by watching Loop operate in open mode. Becoming familiar with the algorithm can be easier by watching it in action rather than only reading about it in docs. Testing \u2301 A great benefit of open loop mode is that you can establish a baseline of BG trends without the influence of temp basals from Loop. This is particularly helpful if you haven't used Medtronic sites/pumps prior to Loop. You may find that your basal rates change significantly coming from other brands of pumps. Taking the time to establish a good Medtronic pump basal profile will set you up for a smoother transition to close loop mode. Test your ISF during open loop time too, as ISF is an important component for every Loop calculation for temp basals. Every 5 minutes, Loop uses your ISF...so it's worth testing it ahead of close loop mode. Eventual BG \u2301 One of the best things you can do is to train yourself to watch the eventual BG rather than the current BG for helping understand Loop recommendations for temp basals. So many of us have become accustomed to dealing with current BGs and perhaps IOB at the same time...but Loop is also looking at BG momentum, carbs on board, restrospective trends. Loop is utilizing all of those variables to predict an eventual BG. It's current decisions are based on that eventual BG. Training yourself to watch that eventual BG will help you understand the temp basals being offered at any given time. Carb Absorption \u2301 Probably the next most difficult transition involves using carb absorption as a component to every meal bolus. Understand that the default carb absorption times in Loop may not work for your particular body. Similar to how you perhaps had used extended boluses for meals that impacted BGs longer than the duration of your insulin...that same idea applies to estimating your carb absorption times. Watch your meals and try to estimate how long they are impacting your BG for various types of food. Watch the times when Loop would've wanted to suspend or high temp basal...ask yourself why it would be doing that. Especially ask yourself if that is the same decision as you would've made at that time in a meal normally. Would you be worried that you might go low later if you see Loop offering high temp basal early after a meal? Would you be worried about going high later if Loop wants to suspend basals instead? If you put some effort into this effort before closing the loop, it will pay off with a smoother transition to closed loop. Troubleshooting \u2301 Get used to carrying the RileyLink around. Find how far your connectivity stretches before you have pump communication problems. Get used to troubleshooting yellow and red loops, finding out the pattern/cause of any potential loop issues. You'll be less frustrated starting on closed loop if you aren't dealing with learning new electronics at the same time as you are learning carb absorption times in a closed loop. Learn how to retune your RL. Bolus \u2301 Bolus meals from the Loop, rather than the pump. Become familiar with entering carbs into the Loop, as well as editing them. Watch how long it takes for Loop app to display the bolus after you enact it (hint: there's a delay until the bolus finishes delivery and the pump gets read). Familiarize yourself with the \"Bolus May Have Failed\" notifications and how to handle them. Double check the pump and watch to see if the bolus indeed didn't enact before trying to give the bolus again. Caregiver training \u2301 If you are the parent of a t1d kid using Loop, make sure you take the time to educate caregivers around your family and school for how to use Loop.

When you are operating in open loop mode, Loop is offering recommedendations for temp basals and will display them on the main screen. The recommendations will not be enacted unless you specifically choose to enact the temp basal. Usually in open loop mode, you aren't really enacting the recommended basals but instead watching how the recommendations come in and figuring out WHY they are being recommended. It is understandable to want to jump straight away into close loop mode, but a lot can be learned by watching Loop operate in open mode. Becoming familiar with the algorithm can be easier by watching it in action rather than only reading about it in docs.","title":"Open Loop"},{"location":"operation/loop/open-loop/#testing","text":"A great benefit of open loop mode is that you can establish a baseline of BG trends without the influence of temp basals from Loop. This is particularly helpful if you haven't used Medtronic sites/pumps prior to Loop. You may find that your basal rates change significantly coming from other brands of pumps. Taking the time to establish a good Medtronic pump basal profile will set you up for a smoother transition to close loop mode. Test your ISF during open loop time too, as ISF is an important component for every Loop calculation for temp basals. Every 5 minutes, Loop uses your ISF...so it's worth testing it ahead of close loop mode.","title":"Testing"},{"location":"operation/loop/open-loop/#eventual-bg","text":"One of the best things you can do is to train yourself to watch the eventual BG rather than the current BG for helping understand Loop recommendations for temp basals. So many of us have become accustomed to dealing with current BGs and perhaps IOB at the same time...but Loop is also looking at BG momentum, carbs on board, restrospective trends. Loop is utilizing all of those variables to predict an eventual BG. It's current decisions are based on that eventual BG. Training yourself to watch that eventual BG will help you understand the temp basals being offered at any given time.","title":"Eventual BG"},{"location":"operation/loop/open-loop/#carb-absorption","text":"Probably the next most difficult transition involves using carb absorption as a component to every meal bolus. Understand that the default carb absorption times in Loop may not work for your particular body. Similar to how you perhaps had used extended boluses for meals that impacted BGs longer than the duration of your insulin...that same idea applies to estimating your carb absorption times. Watch your meals and try to estimate how long they are impacting your BG for various types of food. Watch the times when Loop would've wanted to suspend or high temp basal...ask yourself why it would be doing that. Especially ask yourself if that is the same decision as you would've made at that time in a meal normally. Would you be worried that you might go low later if you see Loop offering high temp basal early after a meal? Would you be worried about going high later if Loop wants to suspend basals instead? If you put some effort into this effort before closing the loop, it will pay off with a smoother transition to closed loop.","title":"Carb Absorption"},{"location":"operation/loop/open-loop/#troubleshooting","text":"Get used to carrying the RileyLink around.

Yellow alerts will not cause a build to fail, and can generally be ignored. Red alerts will have to be resolved before you can successfully build Loop app. Yellow error alerts do not cause the build to fail, those are just warnings. Occasionally, a Loop version may have some minor discrepencies that cause a yellow alert...but you can ignore those. Red error alerts will have to be resolved before you can successfully build Loop app. The most common cause of red alerts comes from being out of sync between the various parts of Apple's infrastructure (iOS, Xcode, Swift, watchOS, macOS) that are frequently updated. For every update to iOS/Xcode, the volunteer Loop developers have to make changes to the underlying source code. This takes time...so when Apple updates are pushed out, sometimes there may be a short period of time until the code is updated to match. If you encounter a build error that is not listed below, please get on the Facebook Looped group or Gitter to let us know. Before looking at the solutions below...please double click on your red error message to bring up additional information about your particular error message. Merely seeing the title of the error code on the left column of Xcode is not necessarily enough information to discern what error is causing your build to fail. And therefore, you need to look at the detailed message and find the matching error message in the sections below. Build Failed in frameworks \u2301 If you see a Cartfile failure and several other red errors (in particular saying there is \"no such module 'LoopKit'\"), double click on the Cartfile error message. If it says that the build failed in one of the schemes, as shown in the screenshot below, then you need to open Terminal app. You will use the command cd ~/downloads/loop-master && carthage update . NOTE: YOU MAY HAVE TO CHANGE THE COMMAND SLIGHTLY. If your loop folder isn't named loop-master and instead is loop-master-2 or loop-dev or some other folder name...change the command to match your folder's actual name. Carthage update will take about 15 minutes to run successfully. A successful carthage update will look like the following: Once carthage update has run successfully, you can return to Xcode and press the build button again. Your project should build successfully. If your carthage update fails, try opening Terminal app and running these commands to clear out your carthage cache and saved derived data in Xcode: rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/org.carthage.CarthageKit and rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData After running those commands, retry the cd ~/downloads/loop-master && carthage update (remembering to update the name of your Loop download folder, as needed). IF there are still red errors and you post for help in Looped group or Gitter... TAKE A SCREENSHOT of the whole Xcode screen after you double click on the red error message (command-shift-space bar-4 will make a screenshot tool active and the screenshot will save to your desktop). Or even better, copy and paste the \"xcodebuild output can be found at...\" log file that is listed in yellow/orange color in the carthage update screen. You can get to that log file by copy and pasting the file path (in yellow) into your Finder >> Go >> Go to Folder.. Once you open that log file, you can scroll to the bottom of the file and there will be detailed information about why carthage update failed. Please do not post without being able to provide detailed information. It is very difficult to help troubleshoot based on vague \"I have errors\" information. Pending Certificate Request \u2301 Error message: \"You already have a current iOS Development certificate or a pending certificate request.\" Solution: This error message has just recently started to appear for some new Loop builders. To resolve the issue, please login to your Developer account at developer.apple.com and then click on \"Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles\". Under that screen, you will see \"Development\" under the \"Certificates\" section in column on the left. You will need to click on the certificates, and choose to \"revoke\" from the options that show after you click on the certificate. Confirm the warning message that will appear asking \"Do you want to revoke the certificate?\" After you do that, return to Xcode and open up Xcode preferences. Under the Accounts section of Preferences, click on the minus sign to delete your Apple ID. Re-enter your Apple ID (yes...add that account right back that you literally just deleted), return to your Loop's target signing areas in Xcode and your error message should have resolved itself now as a new certificate will have been issued and a provisioning profile should have been created automatically. For double measure, you can verify that the iOS development certificates are all in good working order by clicking on your \"Manage Certificates\" in your Xcode Preferences, Accounts and viewing the iOS development Certificates. You should have one for your account that has a clean status similar to the screenshot below. Outdated Xcode \u2301 Error message: The error message may change over time and Xcode versions...currently if you use iOS 12 and have not updated to Xcode 10, you will receive the following errors when you try to build: Solution: You will need to go to your computer's App Store and install the Xcode app update. Command Line Tools \u2301 Error message: \" Invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools) \" or \" unable to find utility \"xcodebuild\", not a developer tool or in PATH \" Solution: Go to your Xcode preferences and under the Locations tab, select \"Xcode 10\" in the dropdown menu for Command Line Tools. Command CodeSign failed \u2301 Error message: \" errSecInternalComponent, Command CodeSign failed with a nonzero exit code \" Solution: This error message has been more frequent lately, but I believe it is due to inadvertently saying \"no\" to allowing Keychain Access. Regardless the solution is as follows: Close Xcode Open your Keychain Access application (found in Applications within the Utilities folder, similar to where Terminal app is found) In the upper left corner of keychain access, make sure you have the keychain login highlighted and then click the large lock icon above the keychains area (High Sierra users) or right-click the lock next to the login (Mojave macOS users). Click the lock closed, and then click the lock to open it again. You will be prompted for a password. Enter your computer admin password. Close Keychain Access app. Open your Loop project again in Xcode. In the main Xcode menu (grey menu bar at the very top of your Apple display area), select the word Product and then select the option for Clean .

Carthage update message \u2301 If you see a message about updating carthage version, open Terminal app and enter the following command brew update && brew upgrade carthage Unrecognized arguments: --cache-builds \u2301 Error message: \" Unrecognized arguments: --cache-builds \" Solution: Please open your Terminal app found in the Applications>>Utilities folder and then enter /usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\" Confirm installation by pressing enter, and then typing in your computer password. When the installation finishes, use the command brew link --overwrite carthage . After those two steps, you can close out Terminal app, return to Xcode and press the build/play button again. Abort with Payload \u2301 Error message: \" Abort with payload \" Your app will only open briefly with a white screen and then close, if you build with this error. Solution: This error message is caused by either Saving Loop download folder into an iCloud mapped drive, or Having a space in the name of your Loop download folder. Rename the folder to have no spaces and/or move it back to the Downloads folder, then rebuild. Apple Watch: Loop app not appearing \u2301 Error: Apple watch app is not appearing .

Note: Every effort will be made to update the line numbers as the code is updated, but there may be times where the screenshots and line numbers are slightly different than the current version of Loop code. These instructions have been updated for Loop v1.9.3. Disable Authentication for Bolusing \u2301 Depending on your iPhone preferences and model, you may have Face ID or Touch ID enabled. Those security features will also be used to authenticate bolus delivery in Loop. You can choose to disable authentication (i.e., not require Face ID, Touch ID, or passcode for bolusing) through the following code customization: Modify Line 191 in the Loop>>View Controllers>>BolusViewController.swift. Add the false && as shown in the screenshot below: Workout Range Duration \u2301 If you\u2019d like more than just the standard 1 or 2 hour duration for the Workout Range, you can add or modify the code to add another time interval or edit the existing ones. Go to the Loop>>Extensions>>UIAlertController.swift and modify Line 30. The default has 1 and 2 hours as shown where the arrow is pointing in the screenshot. You can edit those to whatever duration you want (in units of hours) and add a duration if you prefer. If you\u2019d like 1, 2, and 3 hours options...simply edit the numbers in the brackets to read [1, 2, 3]. It is possible to enter less than 1 hour intervals such as 15min, 30 min, 45 min by editing the brackets to read [0.25, 0.5, 0.75]. Default Carb Absorption Times \u2301 Loop\u2019s default carb absorption times are based on the high, medium, and low glycemic index absorption curves presented in Think Like A Pancreas by Gary Scheiner. Currently the lollipop icon is set for 2 hours, taco icon for 3 hours, and pizza icon for 4 hours. You can modify these defaults to suit your needs, however modification of these values it not as helpful/common as previous Loop versions. Ever since Loop v1.4, Loop has included dynamic carb absorption means that Loop will start with your entered carb absorption time, multiply it by 1.5, and then dynamically adjust the absorption time (either shorter or longer) based on the observed BG impacts. So, typically, most people are finding that modification of the default carb absorption times is no longer necessary. If you would like to modify those defaults, you can do so in the Loop>>Managers>>LoopDataManager.swift Lines 67-69. Note the times are in hours, not minutes, in the code. Neutral Temp Basals \u2301 With the default installation, when Loop calculates that the recommended temp basal matches the basal rate in your Loop basal rate schedule (aka \"neutral temp basal\") rather than setting a temp basal, Loop will cancel any currently running temp basal and let the pump just run the scheduled basal. Assuming you are using Loop v1.9.3 and the \"save to pump...\" command to make basal rate schedule edits, Loop and the pump will be matching and this will not cause any issues. If you would like Loop to instead set neutral temp basals, you can edit lines 151 and 155 in the Loop>>Managers>>DoseMath.swift file to read return self as shown in screenshot below. This will result in Loop setting neutral temp basals when the recommended temp basal matches the Loop's basal schedule. The potential downsides are slightly more battery consumption, and slightly greater opportunity for temp basal failures as it is a longer pump communication than simply canceling a temp basal. Exponential Insulin Curve \u2301 The Exponential Insulin Curve Models (Rapid-Acting Adult, Rapid-Acting Child, and Fiasp) are defaulted to an insulin duration of 360 minutes...but the peak activity of the various curves differs: Rapid-acting adult curve peaks at 75 minutes Rapid-acting child curve peaks at 65 minutes Fiasp peaks curve peaks at 55 minutes If you wish to customize these values, you can adjust them on Lines 22-38 in the Common>>Models>>Insulin>>ExponentialInsulinModelPreset.swift file Loop Logo \u2301 If you want an app logo other than the default green circle for your Loop app, you can easily customize this. To make it easy to generate the correct sizes of icons, you can use a site like appicon.build and just drag and drop your source image. The source image needs to be 1024 pixels x 1024 pixels. The site will email you a zip file. Double click the zip file, choose the \u201cios\u201d folder, and copy the contents of the Appicon.appiconset as shown highlighted below. Now navigate to the corresponding Loop folder as shown below. Replace the contents of the Appicon.appiconset with your copied images. You can confirm the successful change by looking in Xcode. You should see your custom logo in the Appicon set now. You will also likely see a yellow alert that there are \u201cunassigned children\u201d. This alert will not prevent your app from building, it\u2019s simply because the zip file contained more sizes of images than Loop app uses. You can just leave the unassigned images as is. Apple Watch Customizations \u2301 Recommended Bolus Autofill \u2301 The Apple Watch's default is to autofill to 75% of the recommended bolus. If you wish, you can customize so that the watch autofills a different percentage. To do this, the multiplier can be changed from 0.75 to a value of your choice. A value of 1 will autofill 100% of the recommended bolus. A value of 0 will autofill 0% of the recommended bolus. Go to the Watchapp Extension>>Controllers>>BolusInterfaceController.swift. Edit the section of line 96 for your customization. Adjust sensitivity of digital crown for carb and bolus entry \u2301 The rate of change of the carb and bolus entry pickers when using the digital crown can be altered. You'll need to edit two lines in files within the WatchApp Extension>>Controllers folder. In BolusInterfaceController.swift edit line 162, and in AddCarbsInterfaceController.swift edit line 194. The 1/24 value is the ratio of rotations of the crown to the amount of change in the value. Changing it to 1/12 would mean that twice as many turns would be needed for the same amount of carb or bolus entry.","title":"Code Customization"},{"location":"setup/build/code_customization/#code-customizations","text":"Based on Loop users\u2019 experience, there are some customizations that you may want to incorporate ahead of building your Loop app and Apple Watch app. These customizations must be done prior to building the Loop app onto your iPhone, they cannot be done from within the app itself.

Currently the lollipop icon is set for 2 hours, taco icon for 3 hours, and pizza icon for 4 hours. You can modify these defaults to suit your needs, however modification of these values it not as helpful/common as previous Loop versions. Ever since Loop v1.4, Loop has included dynamic carb absorption means that Loop will start with your entered carb absorption time, multiply it by 1.5, and then dynamically adjust the absorption time (either shorter or longer) based on the observed BG impacts. So, typically, most people are finding that modification of the default carb absorption times is no longer necessary. If you would like to modify those defaults, you can do so in the Loop>>Managers>>LoopDataManager.swift Lines 67-69.

Assuming you are using Loop v1.9.3 and the \"save to pump...\" command to make basal rate schedule edits, Loop and the pump will be matching and this will not cause any issues. If you would like Loop to instead set neutral temp basals, you can edit lines 151 and 155 in the Loop>>Managers>>DoseMath.swift file to read return self as shown in screenshot below. This will result in Loop setting neutral temp basals when the recommended temp basal matches the Loop's basal schedule.

Loop is written in code that is stored online and available for free download. In order to compile all that code into a useable app, you need to use a free Apple program called Xcode. However, Apple is particular about apps and who can install custom apps on their devices, so you will have to enroll in Apple's Developer Program. Once you enroll as a developer, you will be able to \"sign\" the Loop app in Xcode so that it will properly install onto your iPhone. While all of this is straight-forward...I'll tell you some hints upfront to save time. Check your watchOS, iPhone OS, macOS, Xcode first to see if they need updates. If you have iOS 12 (or newer), you will need at a minimum watchOS 4.3, macOS 10.13.6, and Xcode 10. If you have newer versions than the minimum, that is fine. Downloading Xcode can take hours depending on your internet connection speed. You can do that ahead of time if you want to save yourself some waiting when you're ready to build. Apple watches need to be paired with the iPhone BEFORE the Loop app is built onto the phone in order to have the Loop on the watch, too. If you pair a new Apple watch later, you'll have to rebuild the Loop app onto the iPhone again, before the watch will work with Loop functions. Setup your Apple Computer \u2301 Verify macOS \u2301 You need to be running macOS 10.13.6 (High Sierra) or 10.14 (Mojave), so verify by clicking the apple logo in your computer display's upper left corner and selecting About this Mac . If your macOS is not the minimum version, click on the Software Update button and update. If your computer is older than late 2009/2010 (depending on computer model), you may not be able to update sufficiently. You can check the latest macOS compatibility here . Install Homebrew \u2301 Homebrew is a program that will allow us to install the needed packages to build Loop. Open the Terminal application on your computer. It is located in the Applications folder, and then look in the Utilities subfolder for the Terminal application. Copy and paste the line below into Terminal prompt. Press return after you paste it in. /usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\" There will be a prompt asking if you want to continue. Press return to continue, then it may prompt for your password. Enter your computer user password (don't worry, Terminal app doesn't show keystrokes when you enter passwords, but it is still reading your typing). Wait while the script does its thing...you\u2019ll see info scroll by and then it will pause for awhile. Eventually, it will be done and you\u2019ll see something that says \u201cInstallation successful\u201d and you\u2019ll have a ready Terminal prompt again. You can close the Terminal application now. You\u2019re done with it. You do not need to do these steps again for any subsequent Loop builds. Setup your Apple Developer Account \u2301 In order to build your own copy of the Loop app onto your iPhone, you will need an Apple developer account. You will have two options for your individual account; free or paid. If you decide to use a FREE developer account, here's what you need to know: Loop apps signed with a free developer team will expire after 7 days. On the 7th day, your Loop app will simply turn white when you open it and then immediately close. To rebuild the Loop app, you will have to find a computer and rebuild the app onto your iPhone again. You cannot rebuild the app on day 5 (when it is convenient, for example)...hoping to reset the 7-day clock. The app will still expire on the 7th day from when it was first signed and created. If you decide to switch to a paid account after trying out the free account, you will need to rebuild your Loop app with a new main app bundle identifier (this will make sense when you go through the rest of these instructions...just make a mental note for now) and sign with the new team name. If you decide to use a PAID developer account, here's what you need to know: Loop apps signed with a paid developer team will last for a full year. The paid developer account is $99 per year and is default set to auto-renew annually. You can change that selection in your developer account settings at any time. If your household has multiple Loop users, only one developer account is needed. That one developer account can be used to sign multiple Loop apps. If you have decided to use the free developer account, you don't have to do anything right now. We will create it a little later in this process. However, if you've decided to use a paid developer account, go to the Apple Developer website to enroll in an individual account. (Note: The Apple ID you use to enroll in the developer program does not need to be the same Apple ID as the Loop iPhone uses, for example parent installing Loop on kid's iPhone. Typically for the developer enrollment, use the Apple ID of the person who will be doing the Loop app building.) After you enroll, make sure you look for a confirmation email. Apple says it can take up to 24 hours to confirm and setup a new Apple developer account, however some people have had the process only take minutes. It can vary. Periodically, Apple will update the license agreement for the Developer Program. When that happens, you'll need to login to your developer account and accept the new license agreement before you can sign a new/updated Loop app again. Setup Xcode \u2301 Open the App Store application on your computer. Search for Xcode and click on the link to download/install Xcode for free. The most current version of Xcode is 10. The file size is fairly large so expect about 45 minutes, or even multiple hours, to download depending on your internet speed. If you have iOS 12, you will need version Xcode 10 at least to build the current Loop app. If you have a previous installation of Xcode, please make sure to check for updates first, before building Loop. Once you have Xcode downloaded, open it from your Applications folder. There may be a short delay as Xcode installs new Command Line Tools that the app uses. Once Xcode is open and ready, we will start with adding your new developer account to Xcode. IMPORTANT NOTES: Do not stop the installation of Command Line Tools, that is an important installation for Xcode to work properly. When the installation is done, please check that your Command Line Tools installed correctly by opening your Xcode preferences and checking the Locations tab to make sure you have Xcode 10 selected. Go to the Xcode main menu (top left of your screen) and select Preferences from the Xcode dropdown menu. Then, click on the \u201cAccounts\u201d tab in the Preferences window and then press the + in the lower left corner to add an Apple ID account. If you want to use a free developer account, you will simply enter your Apple ID in this section and Xcode will automatically enroll your Apple ID in the free developer program. If you enrolled in the paid account already, enter the Apple ID of the paid developer account. The screenshot below shows the labeling of team names based on whether from free account vs. paid account. Free teams will have (personal team) after the name. Finally, we are going to turn on Line Numbers to make some later steps in the build process easier. Go to the \"Text Editing\" tab in the top of the Preferences window. Click the box to show line numbers. You are now done setting up Xcode. Great job! You will not need to redo the account setup steps on any subsequent builds or updates of your Loop app. Xcode will remember these settings. Download Loop Code \u2301 Next, you\u2019ll need to obtain the Loop code in order to build the app on your computer. Click on ONE of the links below to download your Loop source code. We recommend Master branch be used to build your Loop. Loop: Master branch Loop: Dev branch Master vs Dev? What is the difference? The Loop code resides in GitHub within a repository. A repository is kind of like a project's bookshelf, holding various books versions (aka branches) of a project. The master branch is considered a stable version. Any new features or options are first tested in a dev (short for \"development\") branch of the Loop. New or inexperienced users should not build from the dev branch of Loop, as there is a greater likelihood of encountering bugs or glitches. If you hear of \"new features in dev\", these are things that may be eventually merged into the master branch once any bugs are worked out. IMPORTANT NOTES: Best practice is to leave your Loop code in your Downloads folder. If you store your Loop code a different folder than Downloads (such as your Documents folder or Desktop), make sure the specified folder is not an iCloud drive. Storing your Loop code in an iCloud drive folder will prevent Loop from building successfully. How do you know if a folder is an iCloud drive? Check your System Preferences. If your System Preferences for iCloud is set as shown below, your Documents and Desktop folders are iCloud drives and NOT appropriate places to save your Loop download. Depending on your browser and settings, your Loop download may or may not automatically unzip. If it does not unzip automatically, you can right-click on the zip file and choose to \"Open With\" Archive Utility. This will create a blue folder called Loop-master . HOWEVER, if you already have an existing Loop-master folder from a previous download, the name of the next download will be something like Loop-master (1) . The problem with that folder name is that it contains a space...and spaces in the name will cause your Loop build to fail. So, either delete old copies of Loop before downloading/unzipping or rename the folder(s) to ensure that NO SPACES are in the folder name. Installing Loop using Xcode \u2301 Here\u2019s where the fun really begins. You\u2019re about to build your Loop app. Go to your Downloads folder, open the Loop-master folder (or whatever you named it...double check that the folder does not contain any spaces in the folder name, as described above), and double click on Loop.xcodeproj. A warning may appear asking if you really want to open it, click Open. Xcode will get itself organized and installed, this may take a few minutes. Once Xcode has finished indexing, the Loop project's various folders and files will appear in the far left column (if you don't see the files/folders, click on the little blue folder icon at the top of that far left column). At the very top, click on the blue \"Loop\" at the top of the list. Then click on the box in the middle screen to reveal the targets column. The four targets we will sign in the upcoming steps are now easily viewable. Connect your iPhone via cable to the computer, select your iPhone from the very top of the drop down list. Your iPhone\u2019s personal name should be at the top of the list. Don't accidentally select the generic iOS simulators listed below your iPhone's name. Helpful Tip If your iPhone has a lock enabled, Xcode will not be able to install Loop app once your phone locks during the build progress. Please temporarily disable the lock until you finish building Loop app. Go to your iPhone Settings >> Display & Brightness >> Auto-Lock and set it to Never . You can reset your lock once Loop is done building onto the phone. These next steps are usually only needed on the first Loop build; they can be skipped on subsequent builds. If this is the first time your iPhone has been plugged in to this computer, you will need to open the iPhone and select \"Trust this Computer\" before your device will be useable in the menu selection. If this is the first time you are building an app onto this iPhone using this particular Apple developer account, you will need to \u201cregister the device\u201d to your developer account. The device registration screen, as shown below, may appear when your iPhone is selected. If these prompts for \"register device\" don't immediately appear, there will be a prompt later to register device. Either registration prompt, now or later, will work. Once you select your device (your iPhone's name), we are ready to start signing the four targets. However, before we go any further, it is important to be ready for a codesign/keychain access prompt that you will see sometime soon during the subsequent steps. We are bringing it to your attention now so that you don't accidentally dismiss this too quickly. This prompt above, when you see it, requires you to enter your computer password and then select \"Always Allow\". This prompt is a curious one though, and many times the prompt will ask several times in a row. In frustration, people think the prompt must be broken because it keeps reappearing and then people will press deny or cancel. Don't deny. Keep entering your computer password and pressing the Always Allow button...as many times as it takes. Eventually, the necessary amount of access points will be resolved and the prompt won't return again. This is only needed for first time Xcode users. Now that we have that advisory out of the way, let's get back to signing those four targets. We will start with the Loop target, the first one on the target list. Under the \"Signing\" area, select the dropdown menu where it currently says \"none\". Choose your team that you'd like to sign with. If you select a team name with (personal team), your app will expire after 7 days. If you select a team name without that (personal team), your app will last a full year. If you never signed up for a free developer account, you will not have a (personal team) showing. Make sure you keep the \"automatically manage signing\" box checked above the team selection area. Once you choose your signing team, Xcode will automatically generate provisioning profiles and signing certificates. If this is the first time you are building on this iPhone with this developer account, you may again be prompted to register the device. Simply click on the \"Register Device\" button to confirm. A successfully signed target will have a provisioning profile and signing certificate similar to the screenshot below. Click on each of the three remaining targets, and repeat the signing steps by choosing the same team name as you selected in the first target. Do you want customizations before you finish building? New Loop users : Customizations are not a required part of any Loop build. As you gain experience in how you use your Loop app, you may want to customize some of the features. You can always update your Loop app to add customizations at a later time. Really though, building with the standard, default installation is JUST FINE. If you want any custom configurations to your Loop or Watch apps, now is the time to make them before you finish with the last step of Loop installation on your iPhone. Follow the step-by-step instructions on the Code Customizations page. When you\u2019ve completed those customizations, please return here and follow the next steps to finish the installation of Loop. Have you paired your Apple Watch already? New Apple Watch users : If you have an unopened Apple watch and want to use it with Loop, first pair the watch with the iPhone before continuing to the next steps. If you get a new watch after building the Loop app, you'll need to redo your Loop build. (Don't worry, it's as easy as pressing play on your saved Loop project.) Existing Apple Watch users : Please update your watchOS prior to building Loop app. The current version of Loop requires watchOS 4 or newer. All done with any customizations? Have your Apple watch paired and updated? Let\u2019s finish the installation of the Loop app onto your iPhone. Double check to make sure your iPhone's name is still selected and then press the \u201cplay\u201d button (or build button) to start Xcode on its way. You\u2019ll see the progression of the build in the status window. New builds can take about 20-40 minutes depending on the speed of the computer and internet. Just be patient. Subsequent builds from the same download folder will be much faster. If the build is successful, your brand new Loop app will have a screen open immediately on the iPhone asking about allowing Loop notifications and Health App access. Allow Loop to send you notifications. In the next screen that follows that, click on the Turn All Categories On line and then click Allow in the upper right corner. If you get a message that your build failed, please review the Build Errors page. Read your error message(s), find the matching error in the Build Errors page, and follow the directions for repairing the error. First time builders: If this is the first time you have installed an app on your iPhone using your developer account, you may get a warning like below. Don't worry, Loop installed on the phone but needs you to do an extra step on the phone before Loop app can open. Just follow the directions shown in the warning for what you need to do on your iPhone, and the issue resolves very quickly. Click ok and you can safely disconnect your iPhone from the computer. (If you don\u2019t get a warning and the Loop app installs but does not open, you may still need to go to Settings->General->Device Management and enable trust for your Developer Account.) CONGRATS! YOU JUST INSTALLED LOOP! While the Loop app has been built...you are not done with these docs yet. There are valuable pieces of information you will need to read in order to get, and keep, your Loop working. Please continue on with the Loop App Setup section of these docs. STOP...did you read that blue box above? Are you tempted to just start pushing buttons in Loop since it looks so easy? PLEASE read about the Loop App Setup. There are four sections: Loop settings , Loop services , RileyLink menu , and Pump setup . All of them have very valuable information to read.","title":"Building App"},{"location":"setup/build/installing/#overview","text":"The overall installation process is pretty simple.

You will not need to redo the account setup steps on any subsequent builds or updates of your Loop app. Xcode will remember these settings.","title":"Setup Xcode"},{"location":"setup/build/installing/#download-loop-code","text":"Next, you\u2019ll need to obtain the Loop code in order to build the app on your computer. Click on ONE of the links below to download your Loop source code. We recommend Master branch be used to build your Loop. Loop: Master branch Loop: Dev branch Master vs Dev? What is the difference? The Loop code resides in GitHub within a repository. A repository is kind of like a project's bookshelf, holding various books versions (aka branches) of a project. The master branch is considered a stable version. Any new features or options are first tested in a dev (short for \"development\") branch of the Loop. New or inexperienced users should not build from the dev branch of Loop, as there is a greater likelihood of encountering bugs or glitches. If you hear of \"new features in dev\", these are things that may be eventually merged into the master branch once any bugs are worked out. IMPORTANT NOTES: Best practice is to leave your Loop code in your Downloads folder. If you store your Loop code a different folder than Downloads (such as your Documents folder or Desktop), make sure the specified folder is not an iCloud drive. Storing your Loop code in an iCloud drive folder will prevent Loop from building successfully. How do you know if a folder is an iCloud drive? Check your System Preferences. If your System Preferences for iCloud is set as shown below, your Documents and Desktop folders are iCloud drives and NOT appropriate places to save your Loop download. Depending on your browser and settings, your Loop download may or may not automatically unzip. If it does not unzip automatically, you can right-click on the zip file and choose to \"Open With\" Archive Utility. This will create a blue folder called Loop-master . HOWEVER, if you already have an existing Loop-master folder from a previous download, the name of the next download will be something like Loop-master (1) . The problem with that folder name is that it contains a space...and spaces in the name will cause your Loop build to fail. So, either delete old copies of Loop before downloading/unzipping or rename the folder(s) to ensure that NO SPACES are in the folder name.","title":"Download Loop Code"},{"location":"setup/build/installing/#installing-loop-using-xcode","text":"Here\u2019s where the fun really begins. You\u2019re about to build your Loop app. Go to your Downloads folder, open the Loop-master folder (or whatever you named it...double check that the folder does not contain any spaces in the folder name, as described above), and double click on Loop.xcodeproj. A warning may appear asking if you really want to open it, click Open. Xcode will get itself organized and installed, this may take a few minutes. Once Xcode has finished indexing, the Loop project's various folders and files will appear in the far left column (if you don't see the files/folders, click on the little blue folder icon at the top of that far left column). At the very top, click on the blue \"Loop\" at the top of the list. Then click on the box in the middle screen to reveal the targets column. The four targets we will sign in the upcoming steps are now easily viewable. Connect your iPhone via cable to the computer, select your iPhone from the very top of the drop down list. Your iPhone\u2019s personal name should be at the top of the list. Don't accidentally select the generic iOS simulators listed below your iPhone's name. Helpful Tip If your iPhone has a lock enabled, Xcode will not be able to install Loop app once your phone locks during the build progress. Please temporarily disable the lock until you finish building Loop app. Go to your iPhone Settings >> Display & Brightness >> Auto-Lock and set it to Never . You can reset your lock once Loop is done building onto the phone. These next steps are usually only needed on the first Loop build; they can be skipped on subsequent builds. If this is the first time your iPhone has been plugged in to this computer, you will need to open the iPhone and select \"Trust this Computer\" before your device will be useable in the menu selection. If this is the first time you are building an app onto this iPhone using this particular Apple developer account, you will need to \u201cregister the device\u201d to your developer account. The device registration screen, as shown below, may appear when your iPhone is selected. If these prompts for \"register device\" don't immediately appear, there will be a prompt later to register device. Either registration prompt, now or later, will work. Once you select your device (your iPhone's name), we are ready to start signing the four targets. However, before we go any further, it is important to be ready for a codesign/keychain access prompt that you will see sometime soon during the subsequent steps. We are bringing it to your attention now so that you don't accidentally dismiss this too quickly. This prompt above, when you see it, requires you to enter your computer password and then select \"Always Allow\". This prompt is a curious one though, and many times the prompt will ask several times in a row. In frustration, people think the prompt must be broken because it keeps reappearing and then people will press deny or cancel. Don't deny. Keep entering your computer password and pressing the Always Allow button...as many times as it takes. Eventually, the necessary amount of access points will be resolved and the prompt won't return again. This is only needed for first time Xcode users. Now that we have that advisory out of the way, let's get back to signing those four targets. We will start with the Loop target, the first one on the target list. Under the \"Signing\" area, select the dropdown menu where it currently says \"none\". Choose your team that you'd like to sign with. If you select a team name with (personal team), your app will expire after 7 days. If you select a team name without that (personal team), your app will last a full year. If you never signed up for a free developer account, you will not have a (personal team) showing. Make sure you keep the \"automatically manage signing\" box checked above the team selection area. Once you choose your signing team, Xcode will automatically generate provisioning profiles and signing certificates. If this is the first time you are building on this iPhone with this developer account, you may again be prompted to register the device. Simply click on the \"Register Device\" button to confirm. A successfully signed target will have a provisioning profile and signing certificate similar to the screenshot below. Click on each of the three remaining targets, and repeat the signing steps by choosing the same team name as you selected in the first target. Do you want customizations before you finish building? New Loop users : Customizations are not a required part of any Loop build. As you gain experience in how you use your Loop app, you may want to customize some of the features. You can always update your Loop app to add customizations at a later time. Really though, building with the standard, default installation is JUST FINE. If you want any custom configurations to your Loop or Watch apps, now is the time to make them before you finish with the last step of Loop installation on your iPhone. Follow the step-by-step instructions on the Code Customizations page. When you\u2019ve completed those customizations, please return here and follow the next steps to finish the installation of Loop. Have you paired your Apple Watch already? New Apple Watch users : If you have an unopened Apple watch and want to use it with Loop, first pair the watch with the iPhone before continuing to the next steps. If you get a new watch after building the Loop app, you'll need to redo your Loop build. (Don't worry, it's as easy as pressing play on your saved Loop project.) Existing Apple Watch users : Please update your watchOS prior to building Loop app. The current version of Loop requires watchOS 4 or newer. All done with any customizations? Have your Apple watch paired and updated? Let\u2019s finish the installation of the Loop app onto your iPhone. Double check to make sure your iPhone's name is still selected and then press the \u201cplay\u201d button (or build button) to start Xcode on its way. You\u2019ll see the progression of the build in the status window. New builds can take about 20-40 minutes depending on the speed of the computer and internet. Just be patient. Subsequent builds from the same download folder will be much faster. If the build is successful, your brand new Loop app will have a screen open immediately on the iPhone asking about allowing Loop notifications and Health App access. Allow Loop to send you notifications. In the next screen that follows that, click on the Turn All Categories On line and then click Allow in the upper right corner. If you get a message that your build failed, please review the Build Errors page. Read your error message(s), find the matching error in the Build Errors page, and follow the directions for repairing the error. First time builders: If this is the first time you have installed an app on your iPhone using your developer account, you may get a warning like below. Don't worry, Loop installed on the phone but needs you to do an extra step on the phone before Loop app can open. Just follow the directions shown in the warning for what you need to do on your iPhone, and the issue resolves very quickly. Click ok and you can safely disconnect your iPhone from the computer. (If you don\u2019t get a warning and the Loop app installs but does not open, you may still need to go to Settings->General->Device Management and enable trust for your Developer Account.) CONGRATS! YOU JUST INSTALLED LOOP! While the Loop app has been built...you are not done with these docs yet. There are valuable pieces of information you will need to read in order to get, and keep, your Loop working. Please continue on with the Loop App Setup section of these docs. STOP...did you read that blue box above? Are you tempted to just start pushing buttons in Loop since it looks so easy? PLEASE read about the Loop App Setup. There are four sections: Loop settings , Loop services , RileyLink menu , and Pump setup . All of them have very valuable information to read.","title":"Installing Loop using Xcode"},{"location":"setup/loop-settings/health_app_unused_page/","text":"Health App \u2301 Loop app uses the iPhone's Health app to store BGs, insulin, and carbohydrate data.

Generally, the setup of the pump is similar to setting up any pump for non-looping use. One notable exception: you will need to change those batteries more often with Looping. Loop will drain pump batteries much faster than regular pump regimes, and Loop failures will increase in frequency as the pump battery gets low. Roughly, a lithium AAA battery lasts about 15-16 days on an x23 or x54 pump using Loop. While not every setting NEEDS to match between Loop and pump, it is safer to have them match in case your Loop fails and you revert back to normal pump use. You should program the pump settings to match for: Carb ratio Basal rates (Standard schedule) Insulin Sensitivity Factor (ISF) Maximum bolus Maximum basal rate BG targets Basal schedule is the one pump setting that is occassionally used by Loop app during normal looping. When your Loop app decides that the basal rate scheduled in the Loop app is sufficient (i.e., Loop doesn't need to set a temp basal different than the regularly scheduled basal), Loop will cancel any currently running temp basals and let the pump just implement the scheduled basal. This method works best when the pump and Loop are consistent with their basal rate schedules. Loop v1.9 maintains consistency between the two by (1) automatically populating Loop's initial basal rates by reading the pump's existing Standard basal rate schedule when you setup Loop app and (2) any subsequent edits to Loop's basal schedule will need to be saved by writing those changes to the pump at the same time. This ensures that Loop and the pump are always working on the same information for basal rates. Therefore, if you change basal rates later...make sure to do those changes in the Loop app and use Loop to save them to the pump. If you make changes directly in the pump, Loop will not automatically know about those changes and you will cause a mismatch. Keep max basal and max bolus consistent between the pump and Loop. Loop will initially read these Delivery Limits as part of Loop setup, and so consistency will be maintained so long as you use Loop app to make changes to those settings and use Loop to save the changes to the pump. If you manually lower those settings directly in the pump, bypassing Loop, you will likely cause a Loop failure later when Loop tries to set a maximum basal/bolus higher than the edited pump setting.

The \u201con\u201d position is with the switch towards the antenna (the black cylinder on the RileyLink). Your RileyLink will have a solid green light showing when the device is on and connected to the iPhone's BT. A blue light will flash briefly during pump communications. The RileyLink menu is accessed by clicking on the name of the connected RileyLink in the Loop Settings. There are several important commands in the RileyLink menu that you should be aware of. Side Note: The device searching indicator (circle on the right of Devices line) will always be spinning, even after a RileyLink is successfully connected. That is an indicator of a healthy Loop app operation. If you are ever going to be near other Loop users, you may want to consider renaming your RileyLink to a new name (like this one is renamed ToughRL) so that you can pick it out of a crowd. Click on the RileyLink line, and the RileyLink's menu will be displayed. At the top of this menu is a line for the device name. Click on the that line and you will be able to change the name of your RileyLink. (The new name may need to sit for a few seconds before exiting back out of the naming screen for it to save itself. RileyLink must be connected and on to change the name.) Device \u2301 The settings under the Device section are mostly for your information only. However, you can rename your RileyLink to something more unique. This is a good idea if you own more than one or are ever in the presence of more than one RileyLink...you will be able to pick out your connection easier amongst a crowd of \u201cRileyLinks\u201d. The Signal Strength showing under this area of the menu is the signal strength of the BT with the iPhone. It is not the signal strength of the radio communications with the pump. The lower the number, the stronger the BT. As you move the RL and iPhone closer/farther apart, you will be able to see the signal strength change. The Connections Status should say connected if the RileyLink is connected to the iPhone BT. If the status says connecting then you may want to try toggling the iPhone's BT and/or RileyLink's power off/on to help reconnect. Pump \u2301 The Pump ID and Pump Model should be automatically filled in as part of the initial pump setup. Commands \u2301 There are many useful commands that the RileyLink can issue to the pump. Most are simply for gathering information from the pump, but several are important commands to getting your Loop to turn and stay green. Tune Radio Frequency \u2301 The pump and RileyLink communicate via radio frequency. In order to have the best possible communications, RileyLink will test a range of frequencies in order to see which provides the strongest response with the pump. In the event that pump comms fail for over 14 minutes, Loop will automatically retune the RileyLink to see if perhaps the strongest frequency has changed since it was last tuned. When you first setup your Loop app, RileyLink will automatically perform a Tune Radio Frequency to get pump comms started. You can manually tune your radio frequency at any time by clicking on the command. It may take about a minute, but soon you will see a list of frequencies with the tuning strength results beside each frequency. The signal with the lowest value is the strongest and RileyLink will use that frequency (read more about that here ). Exit out of that screen and the command line will now show the frequency (916.xx MHz for North American pumps) and the timestamp of the tune. Now your pump and RileyLink are tuned to talk to each other. When people suggest \"did you (re)tune your RileyLink?\" they are referring to this line's command. A common troubleshooting recommendation is to tune your RL when you have poor pump communications. Just keep in mind that the Loop code has a function that it will automatically retune in the event of poor pump communications within 14 minutes. Loop does this automatically. Manually retuning is only useful for impatience purposes. If Loop has failed longer than 20 minutes, it will have already likely tried a retune...but knock yourself out if you want to try it again manually. Change Time \u2301 Loop automatically prompts you to set your pump time using the Loop app as part of initial Loop setup. It is important that Loop and your pump share a common time setting, otherwise Looping will fail. If you are traveling through timezones or dealing with daylight savings time, please read up on how to safely change your pump time . Always use the RileyLink's Change Time command to change pump time. If you fail to set the pump time by using the RileyLink, Loop will not function properly. Do not use the pump menus to change your pump's time when Looping. MySentry Pair \u2301 MySentry Pairing is for x23 and x54 pumps only. Follow the directions as shown in the RileyLink command screen for MySentry pairing. You do not have to worry about this command if you are using an x15 or x22 model pump, as they do not have MySentry. If you do not perform a MySentry pairing and have an x23 or x54 pump, your loop will only turn green every 15 minutes. Other commands \u2301 Fetch Recent History, Fetch Enlite Glucose, Get Pump Model, Send Button Press, Read Pump Status, and Read Basal Schedule are all ways of asking the pump for information you might be interested in. They are not part of setting up the Loop and will not affect Loop operations. Enable Diagnostic LEDs, Discover Commands, and RileyLink Statistics are commands that are sometimes used by developers to aid in app troubleshooting and debugging. They don't impact Loop operations. Fetch Recent History polls the pump for recent pump events such as boluses, temp basals, primes, rewinds, etc. The amount of information transmitted for a Fetch Recent History is usually quite large and, as a result, may be more prone to an early failure before it succeeds. If the first Fetch Recent History fails, sometimes it is helpful to use the Send Button Press command to sort of \"wake up\" the pump in preparation for communications. Fetch Enlite Glucose is only useful for Medtronic CGM users. The Fetch Enlite Glucose command will pull the recent glucose values saved in the pump history. Dexcom users do not store any glucose data in the pump. Get Pump Model simply returns the pump's model. Send Button Press can be useful to see if the communication between the RileyLink and pump is working. If successful, the screen on the pump will light up and Loop will confirm the button press with a success message. If pump comms are failing, sending a successful button press can help \"wake up\" a pump that perhaps has not been communicating well. Read Pump Status is also nice quick pump read for reservoir volume, pump battery voltage, and pump status (bolusing or suspending). For x23 and x54 pump users, this command will provide the exact pump battery voltage instead of the 25/50/75/100% levels that are reported otherwise. Read Basal Schedule will pull the active basal pattern from the pump so you can review what the current settings are without using pump menu. Enable Diagnostic LEDs will turn on more LED flashes on the RileyLink while it is operating. You will see more blue flashing lights as the RileyLink communicates with the pump. If you tried turning on this feature and decide later that you just don't want to see so many flashing lights, simply reboot the RileyLink by turning the power switch off/on. This will reset the LEDs. Discover Commands just ignore this menu item. RileyLink Statistics tracks how long your RileyLink has stayed successfully operating and gives the developers some useful information about the stability of the RL operations. It really doesn't provide much to the average Loop user, however.","title":"RileyLink menu"},{"location":"setup/loop-settings/rileylink_menu/#configuring-loop-rileylink-menu","text":"RileyLink has a little switch on the side of the circuit board that is the power switch.

Send Button Press can be useful to see if the communication between the RileyLink and pump is working. If successful, the screen on the pump will light up and Loop will confirm the button press with a success message. If pump comms are failing, sending a successful button press can help \"wake up\" a pump that perhaps has not been communicating well. Read Pump Status is also nice quick pump read for reservoir volume, pump battery voltage, and pump status (bolusing or suspending). For x23 and x54 pump users, this command will provide the exact pump battery voltage instead of the 25/50/75/100% levels that are reported otherwise. Read Basal Schedule will pull the active basal pattern from the pump so you can review what the current settings are without using pump menu. Enable Diagnostic LEDs will turn on more LED flashes on the RileyLink while it is operating. You will see more blue flashing lights as the RileyLink communicates with the pump. If you tried turning on this feature and decide later that you just don't want to see so many flashing lights, simply reboot the RileyLink by turning the power switch off/on. This will reset the LEDs. Discover Commands just ignore this menu item. RileyLink Statistics tracks how long your RileyLink has stayed successfully operating and gives the developers some useful information about the stability of the RL operations. It really doesn't provide much to the average Loop user, however.","title":"Other commands"},{"location":"setup/loop-settings/services/","text":"Configuring Loop - Services \u2301 The services listed in this section are OPTIONAL .

Normally, we would start by explaining the displays on an application, but your Loop won\u2019t have much showing initially until we get some basic settings input. So, let\u2019s start by clicking on the Loop Settings button in the tool bar. It looks like a little sprocket. On the settings screen that opens, click on Add Pump. Helpful tip: Before you begin the rest of the setup process, go to your pump menu and turn off Patterns under the basal menu settings. Make sure your Standard basal rate schedule is up-to-date and accurate. Make sure your pump's temp basal type is set to units/hour (not percent). Make sure your maximum basal rate and maximum bolus settings in the pump are reasonably set for your particular needs. Add Pump \u2301 You will now need to do a few simple steps: Make sure your RileyLink is turned on and nearby, then you will see a RileyLink listed in this area of the settings. Actually, you will see a list of any RileyLinks that are in the nearby area. Slide on the toggle for your RileyLink. Add your pump's region, color and serial number. Click the Continue button to finish the addition of your pump. Once your pump is setup, you will be finishing these steps: Change your pump time using the Loop app (and reading all the info on that screen) Import your pump's Standard basal rate schedule, and the maxium basal rate & maximum bolus (collectively called \"delivery limits\" in Loop) Select your pump's battery type (lithium or alakine) Leave the Preferred Data Souce on Event History Event History must be selected for Nightscout to display temp basals, carbs, and boluses from Loop. Event History must also be selected in order for prime events to be detected and NOT contribute to iob during site changes. Once you finish those steps, click on the Settings button in the upper left corner to take you back to the Loop's settings menu. If you ever need to change the pump time or access the RileyLink menus, you will be clicking on the pump's image in Loop settings. CGM Selection \u2301 Select one of the options from the menu: Sof-Sensor/Enlite G4 Share Receiver G5/G6 Transmitter If you select the G5/G6 Transmitter, you will be prompted to enter the transmitter ID number. Don't forget to update your transmitter ID when you change transmitters, otherwise Loop will not work offline. If you are a Dexcom user, don't forget to enter your Dexcom Share information (this will be the same as your Nightscout Bridge username and password, too). By entering your Dexcom Share account info, Loop will be able to fetch from the Dexcom servers via the internet when local BG readings from spying on the receiver/transmitter directly are not working. The switch between local readings to server data pull will happen automatically when needed. When Loop is using data from Dexcom servers, a small cloud will appear above the BG reading in Loop. The Share account login is the same as what you used to login to your Dexcom app on your iPhone. Dexcom Share account is not always the same login info as your Dexcom Clarity account. For G4 users, the Share account is found in the account tab on the app. For G5/G6 users, unfortunately, there is no information in the app displaying what your account name is. The information is entered when you first login to the app and then is never displayed again, nor visible under any information screens. If you have forgotten your G5/G6 account info, you can delete the Dexcom app and redownload it to try logging in again. This will not cause a restart of any sensor sessions in progress. Correction Range \u2301 This is where you set your blood glucose range that you would like Loop to correct to. Correction Range is not necessarily what your target BG range that you have discussed with your endocrinologist; generally the doctor's range may be much wider. For example, you may keep a correction target of 100-100 for Loop to aim to, but use a desired BG target range of 90-150 when discussing things with your endo about \"time in range\". Click the + in the upper right corner to add correction BG range(s). You can have multiple ranges based on time of day, but the first setting of the day needs to begin at midnight to be consistent with your Medtronic pump. Ranges will be entered in mg/dl or mmoL automatically based upon how your BG values appear your BG chart. By default they are set to mg/dl, however once BG values arrive in mmoL these settings can be entered in mmoL. If you are planning to use mmoL, be sure to wait to set your correction range until after you have started to receive BG values. If you do these in the wrong order, then your chart may have incorrect Y axis. If you come across this issue, you can also remove all of your target ranges and enter them again. Once you are receiving BG values in mmoL, you can add your correction range(s) in mmoL. Correction ranges can be a single number, such as 100-100 mg/dL. Generally, you don't want to keep correction ranges too wide otherwise Loop will be sluggish to correct. Most users keep correction range no wider than about 0 to 20 mg/dl between the min and max values. Override Ranges \u2301 Set the \u201coverride\u201d ranges for temporary alternate correction ranges. These override ranges will only be enacted when you specifically activate \"Pre-Meal or \u201cWorkout Mode\u201d using the buttons on the main Loop display or watchface. While active, they replace the correction range for Loop's recommendations. If the override ranges are not entered in this section, the buttons will remain grey and unusable on the main screen. Pre-Meal The pre-meal target is designed to be used to as an easy way to get a small amount of insulin delivered before a meal (similar to the \"eating-soon\" mode discussed in OpenAPS) in order to help control post-meal BG spikes. If your normal target is 100-100 and pre-meal target is 80-80 mg/dl, for example, Loop will give you an extra push to get you to the lower target number before the meal. The pre-meal target, when activated by pressing on the icon, will stay active for one hour, until carbs are entered, or until it is manually cancelled...whichever comes first. Loop will adjust any insulin bolus as needed based on the insulin provided during this pre-meal time. Workout Mode Workout Mode override targets are designed to temporarily set targets higher in anticipation of exercise or other activities which tend to make the Looper more insulin sensitive or need less insulin. By setting a higher temp target ahead of activity, Loop will recommend less basal rate(s) than normally scheduled in order to to bring BGs up to the higher target. The success of this strategy will be dependent on how far in advance of activity the temp target is set. Generally, users set the target approximately 1-2 hours in advance of planned activities...but the optimal timing will depend on the activity, duration, and intensity. Additionally, any insulin on board from recent boluses may overwhelm the Loop's ability to counteract exercise-induced lows through lower temp basals alone. Suspend Threshold \u2301 Suspend Threshold is a required data entry for successful configuration of Loop. Your Loop will not turn green without setting this value. This value affects both bolus and basal recommendations by Loop. Bolus \u2301 If you are trying to bolus a meal while any part of the predicted BG curve is below this suspend threshold value, Loop will not recommend a bolus. Instead, you will need to wait until your prediction curve is above the suspend threshold value in order to bolus. Basal \u2301 If your current or forecasted BG is below the suspend threshold, Loop will always recommend a temp basal rate of 0 u/hr. Basal Rates \u2301 Your basal rates have already been initially populated from the pump's standard basal schedule as part of your initial setup, above. Only one basal schedule may be set in each Loop app. If you need to edit your basal schedule, simply make the edits as needed and then click on Save to Pump... button. As a safety precaution, Loop will not allow you to only save the edits to the Loop app alone...you must successfully save the changes back to the pump to ensure Loop and the pump are in sync. If you make any basal edits and simply use the Settings button to go back to the menu without successfully saving to pump, the changes you made will not be saved in Loop app. Loop v1.9 makes saving to pump a mandatory step to successfully editing basal rates. Delivery Limits \u2301 The maximum basal rate and maximum bolus settings are collectively refered to as Delivery Limits. Your Loop will read these from the pump as part of adding a new pump to Loop. For safety, similar to basal schedule, you must keep these values the same on both the Loop app and within the pump settings. If you edit these settings in Loop app, always use the Save to Pump... button similar to the basal rate edits discussed above. Maximum Basal Rate \u2301 Maximum basal rate is the maximum temporary basal rate that the Loop is allowed to enact to meet your correction range. See the Operation section discussion for Close Loop for some suggestions regarding appropriate Maximum Basal Rate. Maximum Bolus \u2301 Enter your desired single bolus maximum here. For safety, don't set a maximum bolus limit any higher than your typical large meal bolus. Insulin Model \u2301 There are four Insulin Models to choose from; Walsh, Rapid-Acting Adults, Rapid-Acting Children, and Fiasp. If you want to read the nitty-gritty discussion that went into the development of these new curves, you can see that in GitHub here . You can click on each model and see what each model's insulin activity curve looks like. If you select the Walsh model, and adjust the insulin action duration (DIA default is 6 hours), the curve will be adjusted accordingly based on your selection. The differences between the new (Rapid-Acting and Fiasp) models have to do with the timing of the Peak Activity of the insulin. Currently, all the models are defaulted [in the code]( to an insulin duration of 360 minutes...but the peak activity of the various curves differs: Rapid-acting adult curve peaks at 75 minutes Rapid-acting child curve peaks at 65 minutes Fiasp peaks curve peaks at 55 minutes As the peak time decreases, the Loop will expect a quicker insulin impact on BG AND the tail of the insulin dose will be slightly less agressive compared to a curve with a later peak time. In other words, Fiasp will be more powerful soon after a bolus and less powerful 5 hours later than an equal amount of insulin modeled using the other models. The Walsh model's insulin duration can be set by the user from within the app. The peak time of the Walsh curve is 100 min at a DIA of 4 hours. As user adjusts DIA, the peak time will be dynamically adjusted. Carb Ratios \u2301 Click the + in the upper right to add carb ratios for various times of day. Loop works best if you have tested and optimized your carb ratio settings for accuracy. Beware of other apps writing carbs to Health app If you are using a third-party app (such as Spike or MyFitness) that can write carbohydrates to the phone's Health app, you will need to edit the permissions to make sure Loop doesn't double carb entries. You should disable the third-party app's permissions in Health so that it can only read and not write . See Carb Entries with Third Party apps for more information about this setting. Insulin Sensitivities \u2301 Click the + in the upper right to add insulin sensitivities for various times of day. Loop works best if you have tested and optimized your ISF settings for accuracy. Insulin sensitivities can change for many reasons including waiting too long to change your infusion set. Loop will not auto-detect changes in ISF. Closed Loop \u2301 The Closed Loop switch controls the Loop operation mode for the application. This operation mode determines whether Loop automatically enacts recommendations (i.e., sets temp basals) to the insulin pump. When the Closed Loop switch is in the (Off ) position, Loop WILL NOT enact recommended temp basals automatically. Instead, it will display Recommended Temp Basals on the main status display, just above the Glucose graph. This is called Open Loop , and is a good way to understand how Loop will function, and what type of recommendations it would make. If you click on the recommended temp basal line while in Open Loop mode, Loop will implement the temp basal. When the Closed Loop switch is in the ( On) position, Loop WILL automatically enact recommended temp basals on the configured insulin pump. This is known as Closed Loop . Typically, Loop will show the recommended temp basal just above the Glucose graph prior to automatically enacting it. It may take a minute or so for the Loop to enact the recommended basal. Once the temp basal has been enacted successfully on the pump, the recommended temp basal will disappear from the screen and the new temp basal will be represented in the insulin delivery graphics. Issue Report \u2301 If you run into problems or errors with your Loop, the Issue Report can be used to help identify where the problem is occurring. The Issue Report is automatically generated and you can share it via email. Frequently, if you go to Gitter or Facebook for help with a technical problem, an Issue Report will provide insight to what the potential problem is.","title":"Loop Settings"},{"location":"setup/loop-settings/settings/#configuring-loop","text":"Now that you have the Loop app installed on your iPhone, we need to input the settings so that the Loop can work for you.

Offline access to glucose requires a Receiver with Share and the Share2 app to be running on the same iPhone as the Loop app is installed. Internet-dependent access via Share servers is also supported. 2 . x22 model pumps were produced before firmware security patches were implemented, therefore these models are compatible because they will have firmware 2.4A or lower only. You can double check, but thus far all x22 pumps we have seen have compatible firmware. 3 . Firmware 2.4A or lower is required for using closed loop and bolus features. 4 . Worldwide Veo (2.6A or lower) or Canadian/Australian Veo (2.7A or lower) is required for using closed loop and bolus features. A US version of this pump is not available. If you want to triple check compatibility, you can check for presence/absence of \"PC connect\" in the pump. If PC Connect is present, then the pump is NOT compatible. You can find PC connect in the Medtronic's Main Menu, Utilities, Connect Devices. PC Connect, if present, will be the first option showing in that menu, above the word \"Meters\". If you do NOT see PC Connect there...good! Pump Model \u2301 To determine your pump model, look at the back side of your pump. There should be a sticker on the underside of the pump. On the right hand side of the sticker, it says REF MMT-XXXXXX MMT Pump Manufacturer Model (MiniMed Medtronic) 722 Pump Model Number NA Pump Region (NA=North America, CA=Canada/Australia, WW=Worldwide) S Pump Color (S=Smoke, L=Clear/Lucite, B=Blue, P=Pink/Purple) Some pumps may have an \u201cL\u201d or \u201cS\u201d or \"R\" before the pump region, e.g. a model number like MMT-722LNAS. This does not affect Loop compatibility. Pump Differences \u2301 The differences between the pump models are limited. 500 vs 700 : The difference between the Medtronic 500 series and the 700 series pumps is the size of the insulin reservoirs. The 500 series pumps use a 180 unit reservoir, and the 700 series pumps use a 300 unit reservoir (or smaller 180 unit reservoir, if you want). x15/x22 vs x23/x54 : The difference between the x15 and x22 pumps versus the x23 and x54 series pumps has only a few notable mentions: The x23/x54 pumps will allow for smaller insulin deliveries in certain situations, if the smaller scroll rate is selected in the Bolus>Setup>Scroll Rate menu. Loop will have the insulin delivery automatically rounded by the pump to the units available in the pump model, and any smaller adjustments (to make up for the rounding) will be made through Loop\u2019s use of temp basals. If you want the smaller increments of basal rates, you can still enter those values in Loop app's settings and Loop will use those values for the purposes of insulin delivery calculations. Pump Model Basal increments Bolus increments Range 515/715 and 522/722 0.05 0.1 0.1 0.1 deliveries less than 10 units greater than 10 units 523/723 and 554/754 0.025 0.05 0.1 0.025 0.05 0.1 between 0.025 to 0.975 units between 1 to 9.95 units greater than 10 units Additionally, because of the way Loop fetches information from the pump, the x23/x54 series of pumps are slightly better at conserving battery life through the use of the MySentry packets to collect information from the pump. x22 pumps do not use MySentry. The x23/x54 series pumps are also faster at delivering boluses greater than 10 units. On an x23 pump, a 13-unit bolus takes 5:00 minutes to complete. On an x22 pump, a 13-unit bolus takes 8:40 minutes to complete. Pump Firmware \u2301 If you are looking to use a 523/723 or 554/754 pump, you will need to check the firmware version for compatibility. A pump\u2019s firmware is the internal software that runs your pump. Older Medtronic firmware allows Loop to act as a \u201cremote control\u201d to set temp basals and report back pump data. Newer firmware disabled that \u201cremote control\u201d access and therefore cannot be used with these DIY closed loop systems. There is currently no ability to downgrade a pump\u2019s firmware or replace it with older firmware. Before you buy a used pump, make sure you are getting one with compatible firmware. To find your pump\u2019s firmware you will need to power it on. If the pump has not been powered on for some time (i.e., has been in storage without a battery for awhile), it will run through a start-up count and the firmware version will appear on the bottom right of the pump\u2019s screen. Don\u2019t turn away, as the version number will only be displayed for a little while before the screen moves onto other information displays. If the pump has been active recently or has a reservoir installed, follow these steps: Press the button on your pump. Scroll down with the button to the bottom of the status display. Read the bottom line of the display. Other pumps \u2301 While we all would love to have our {insert your favorite manufacturer} pump be compatible with a DIY closed loop system like Loop, unfortunately it just isn't possible right now. There are efforts being made to crack the software code on other pumps (like Omnipod), and when they are successful...believe me...we will tell you about it! Finding a Medtronic pump \u2301 Finding a compatible Medtronic pump is probably the most difficult part for most new Loopers. Our suggestion: Talk to friends in the diabetic community. Ask your endocrinologist. Ask at a local JDRF chapter meeting if someone has an old backup pump they'd be willing to donate to you. Join diabetic supply groups in Facebook; both for-trade and for-sale groups. Check Craigslist often and be willing to expand your search area to include larger cities. Check out the HelpAround, NextDoor, OfferUp, and/or LetGo apps for pumps. Search Medwow for used Medtronic pumps Medwow has been fairly frustrating for most people; poor response rate, high prices. The most success appears to come from either one-on-one discussions with fellow diabetics/doctors or using apps (Craigslist, NextDoor, LetGo, HelpAround). If you are using Craigslist, you may wish to use an app on your iPhone to make the searching easier. There are apps to search multiple cities at once for your keywords and set up alerts. Safe Purchasing \u2301 If you choose to purchase from a remote or unknown seller, here are some tips for safe purchasing: Use PayPal and purchase using the \"Goods and Services\" payment option. This costs nothing for the buyer, but the seller will lose 2.95% of the sale to PayPal fees. PayPal offers some protection for both buyer and seller in the event of fraud. Ask for photos of the pump. Check to make sure the serial number of the pump on the backside matches the serial number of the pump showing in the display menu. Ask for a short video of the pump, or at least a photo of the pump turned on, so that you can see the pump's firmware and model number. Cracks and some wear on these pumps is expected. These pumps are not usually free of marks. Many people are successfully looping on pumps that have cracks and rub marks, but you may want to ask if you are concerned. Ask for shipping that includes a tracking number. USPS Priority Mail's smallest box is a great option. It's only $7.20 domestically in US and includes tracking. Ask the seller to add a small bit of packing protection such as bubble wrap around the pump to keep it safe during shipping. Make sure you get a tracking number within a reasonable period of time after you have paid. Red flags that may indicate a scam: Asking for payment through \"friends and family\" on PayPal, especially if you don't know the person or have any solid references for them. Paying in that way offers you no buyer protection. It's just like giving the seller cash, so you had better trust the seller. Offering an \"almost new\" pump is a big red flag. These pumps should be at least 5 years old by now. Do you really think a 5 year old pump should be unused and sitting in shrink wrap at this point? Seems highly suspicious. There are some out there, but they are very infrequent. Not able to provide new pictures of the pump when requested. Sure they posted some pictures with the ad, but what if they just downloaded them from other people's ads? The seller should be able to furnish a couple \"new\" photos are your request. A good one to ask for is the battery and reservoir tops so you can see the condition of those. Pump Supplies \u2301 Medtronic will not typically sell pump supplies directly to customers who have not previously purchased a registered Medtronic pump. Ask your insurance about purchasing pump supplies through a durable medical equipment (DME) provider. Typically, the DME provider will coordinate with your insurance and doctor's office to get the necessary insurance approval and prescriptions for the supplies. If you are brand new to Medtronic infusion sites, you may want to ask for help from friends to try a variety of infusion sets before purchasing a full 90-day supply of any type in particular.","title":"Insulin Pump"},{"location":"setup/requirements/pump/#insulin-pump","text":"There are a number of insulin pumps manufactured between 2006 \u2013 2012 by Medtronic which are compatible.

The 500 series pumps use a 180 unit reservoir, and the 700 series pumps use a 300 unit reservoir (or smaller 180 unit reservoir, if you want). x15/x22 vs x23/x54 : The difference between the x15 and x22 pumps versus the x23 and x54 series pumps has only a few notable mentions: The x23/x54 pumps will allow for smaller insulin deliveries in certain situations, if the smaller scroll rate is selected in the Bolus>Setup>Scroll Rate menu. Loop will have the insulin delivery automatically rounded by the pump to the units available in the pump model, and any smaller adjustments (to make up for the rounding) will be made through Loop\u2019s use of temp basals. If you want the smaller increments of basal rates, you can still enter those values in Loop app's settings and Loop will use those values for the purposes of insulin delivery calculations. Pump Model Basal increments Bolus increments Range 515/715 and 522/722 0.05 0.1 0.1 0.1 deliveries less than 10 units greater than 10 units 523/723 and 554/754 0.025 0.05 0.1 0.025 0.05 0.1 between 0.025 to 0.975 units between 1 to 9.95 units greater than 10 units Additionally, because of the way Loop fetches information from the pump, the x23/x54 series of pumps are slightly better at conserving battery life through the use of the MySentry packets to collect information from the pump. x22 pumps do not use MySentry. The x23/x54 series pumps are also faster at delivering boluses greater than 10 units. On an x23 pump, a 13-unit bolus takes 5:00 minutes to complete. On an x22 pump, a 13-unit bolus takes 8:40 minutes to complete.","title":"Pump Differences"},{"location":"setup/requirements/pump/#pump-firmware","text":"If you are looking to use a 523/723 or 554/754 pump, you will need to check the firmware version for compatibility. A pump\u2019s firmware is the internal software that runs your pump. Older Medtronic firmware allows Loop to act as a \u201cremote control\u201d to set temp basals and report back pump data. Newer firmware disabled that \u201cremote control\u201d access and therefore cannot be used with these DIY closed loop systems. There is currently no ability to downgrade a pump\u2019s firmware or replace it with older firmware. Before you buy a used pump, make sure you are getting one with compatible firmware. To find your pump\u2019s firmware you will need to power it on. If the pump has not been powered on for some time (i.e., has been in storage without a battery for awhile), it will run through a start-up count and the firmware version will appear on the bottom right of the pump\u2019s screen. Don\u2019t turn away, as the version number will only be displayed for a little while before the screen moves onto other information displays. If the pump has been active recently or has a reservoir installed, follow these steps: Press the button on your pump. Scroll down with the button to the bottom of the status display.

Our suggestion: Talk to friends in the diabetic community. Ask your endocrinologist. Ask at a local JDRF chapter meeting if someone has an old backup pump they'd be willing to donate to you. Join diabetic supply groups in Facebook; both for-trade and for-sale groups. Check Craigslist often and be willing to expand your search area to include larger cities. Check out the HelpAround, NextDoor, OfferUp, and/or LetGo apps for pumps. Search Medwow for used Medtronic pumps Medwow has been fairly frustrating for most people; poor response rate, high prices. The most success appears to come from either one-on-one discussions with fellow diabetics/doctors or using apps (Craigslist, NextDoor, LetGo, HelpAround). If you are using Craigslist, you may wish to use an app on your iPhone to make the searching easier. There are apps to search multiple cities at once for your keywords and set up alerts.","title":"Finding a Medtronic pump"},{"location":"setup/requirements/pump/#safe-purchasing","text":"If you choose to purchase from a remote or unknown seller, here are some tips for safe purchasing: Use PayPal and purchase using the \"Goods and Services\" payment option. This costs nothing for the buyer, but the seller will lose 2.95% of the sale to PayPal fees. PayPal offers some protection for both buyer and seller in the event of fraud. Ask for photos of the pump. Check to make sure the serial number of the pump on the backside matches the serial number of the pump showing in the display menu. Ask for a short video of the pump, or at least a photo of the pump turned on, so that you can see the pump's firmware and model number. Cracks and some wear on these pumps is expected. These pumps are not usually free of marks. Many people are successfully looping on pumps that have cracks and rub marks, but you may want to ask if you are concerned. Ask for shipping that includes a tracking number. USPS Priority Mail's smallest box is a great option. It's only $7.20 domestically in US and includes tracking. Ask the seller to add a small bit of packing protection such as bubble wrap around the pump to keep it safe during shipping. Make sure you get a tracking number within a reasonable period of time after you have paid. Red flags that may indicate a scam: Asking for payment through \"friends and family\" on PayPal, especially if you don't know the person or have any solid references for them. Paying in that way offers you no buyer protection. It's just like giving the seller cash, so you had better trust the seller. Offering an \"almost new\" pump is a big red flag. These pumps should be at least 5 years old by now. Do you really think a 5 year old pump should be unused and sitting in shrink wrap at this point? Seems highly suspicious. There are some out there, but they are very infrequent. Not able to provide new pictures of the pump when requested. Sure they posted some pictures with the ad, but what if they just downloaded them from other people's ads? The seller should be able to furnish a couple \"new\" photos are your request. A good one to ask for is the battery and reservoir tops so you can see the condition of those.","title":"Safe Purchasing"},{"location":"setup/requirements/pump/#pump-supplies","text":"Medtronic will not typically sell pump supplies directly to customers who have not previously purchased a registered Medtronic pump.

This page provides a bit more in-depth information and practical tips about the new release. Minimum OS updates required \u2301 Before you start the update process, please make sure you update your devices to the minimum required versions. macOS Sierra : macOS 10.3.2 High Sierra Xcode : Xcode 9.4 iPhone : iOS 11.1 at a minimum watchOS : watchOS 4.3 Automatic Carthage Installation \u2301 The preparation steps to build Loop have changed. Older versions of Loop required the manual installation of Homebrew and Carthage before you began the installation of Loop. Loop v1.9.3 only requires you to install Homebrew, Xcode will automatically install Carthage in the background if it is not already installed on your computer. So if you are building on a new computer and think \"Wait, aren't I missing a step in the directions? I thought I had to install Carthage somewhere.\"...don't worry. You haven't missed a step, Loop is just going to do it for you. Automatic Main App Bundle ID \u2301 Remember how the first step used to be that you had to change the com.loopkit to something unique-to-you? And if you updated you had to remember what you used last time so that your settings remained with the update? No longer. The Main App Bundle Identifier is now going use your unique development team ID that Apple has assigned using your developer account. You don't have to change anything now. Just leave that as is and go straight to applying any customizations, if you want any. When you sign your targets, Loop will automatically populate all the necessary bundle IDs with the needed information. This does mean that you will have to re-enter your settings in this new app for initial use, but subesquent rebuilds will be easier because the Main App Bundle Identifier will always be consistent and settings will be saved on updates using this new automated ID. To prevent any conflicts, please remove your old app from your phone when you are done setting up this new app. Initial Loop Build Slower \u2301 The new Loop will take longer to build than you are used to. You may even be tempted to think that it has glitched out and stopped (it hasn't). This is due to some changes in the way Loop deals with underlying frameworks that Loop builds. BE PATIENT. Depending on the speed of the computer and internet, your initial build could take between 15-40 mins or so. Subsequent builds will be fast again, it is just the first build that will take awhile. You will see this step take the longest... Building Loop: Cartfile | Running 2 of 2 custom shell scripts Just wait it out. Eventually, Loop will move past that and finish the build. Initial Pump Setup \u2301 You'll notice one of the changes in the update almost immediately when you go to the Loop settings and see an Add Pump prompt. The new pump setup has pretty self-explanatory steps for setting up your pump in Loop. Basal Rates and Delivery Limits (save to pump...) \u2301 Loop now automatically reads and imports the following settings from the pump during initial setup: Basal Rate Schedule Delivery Limits (maximum basal rate and maximum bolus) Even better news? Loop now saves edits to those settings back to the pump. There's a new \"Save to pump...\" button that must be used after you edit those settings in Loop. If you don't use that button, the edits you make to those Loop settings will not be saved in Loop nor in the pump. Therefore, please confirm the edits have been successfully saved before exiting the basal rates screen. The purpose is to keep Loop and your pump in-snyc. Now if Loop fails for whatever reason, you can be sure that the basal rate in the pump will match what you've been using in your Loop. Standard Basal Rate Schedule \u2301 As mentioned above, Loop now has the ability to read/write your basal rate schedule from/to the pump. There is one important fact about this new (amazing) feature. The code is written to interact with the \"Standard\" basal rate schedule in the pump only, not the Pattern A/B basal rate schedules. So, practical tip when updating to and using this new Loop app: Turn Patterns off on the pump menu and use only the Stanard basal rate schedule. Double-check your Standard basal rate schedule is up-to-date What happens if you accidentally have Pattern A/B active? Loop will be saving any edits you make in the Loop app's basal schedule back to the pump's Standard schedule. In instances where Loop fails or cancels a temp basal, your Loop would fall back to Pattern A/B operation which would not have been updated like you had thought. Therefore, turning Patterns off on the pump will prevent any accidental confusion or mismatch between pump and Loop. Pump Clock integration \u2301 As part of the initial setup, Loop will now automatically prompt you to set your pump's time to exactly match your Loop's time. Additionally, if you forget the warnings and set the pump time manually using the pump's menu, Loop app will now have RileyLink automatically get the pump back in-sync with Loop. Loop will fix your mistake. As always, you will not have to worry about pump time changes if you travel. You do not have to change your pump's time when you travel, unless you want to. If you decide to, remember to use your Loop to set the pump's time...don't actually use the pump buttons for time changes. Language Translations \u2301 This release includes several new language translations. If the user has their iPhone's language set to one of the following languages, the Loop app will match. Miscellaneous \u2301 Because I know you will ask: The uploading of meterBG checks to NS using pump-linked Contour Next meters is temporarily not working. There is an open ticket to get this restored. We miss our red dots, too. There is no integral retrospective correction (IRC) or new watch face merged into this release.

The basic steps are: Update iOS, macOS, Xcode, and/or watchOS Download new Loop source code Add any customizations Sign all four targets Build app Update Apple devices \u2301 Between Loop app builds, there's a high liklihood that Apple has updated one or more of the systems involved in your Loop app; your Apple Developer license agreement, your iPhone's iOS, your computer's macOS, your Xcode app, and/or your watchOS. If you miss some of the updates, you may run into build problems. You can check for macOS and Xcode updates using the App Store link under the apple logo in your computer display's upper left corner. Check below to make sure your equipment is running the current versions of the various OS. macOS High Sierra : macOS 10.13.6 Xcode : Xcode 10.1 iPhone : iOS 12.1 Download new Loop source code \u2301 You can use these links to download new versions of the Loop source code. These links will always provide the most recent version of Loop: Loop: Master branch source code OR Loop: Dev branch source code FYI: The Loop source code resides in GitHub within a repository. A repository is kind of like a project's bookshelf, holding various books (aka branches) of a project. The master branch is considered a stable version. Any new features or options are first tested in a dev (short for \"development\") branch of the Loop. New or inexperienced users should not build from the dev branch of Loop. So if you hear of \"new features in dev\", these are things that may be eventually merged into the master branch once any bugs are worked out. IMPORTANT NOTES: Best practice is to leave your Loop source code in your Downloads folder. If you store your Loop code a different folder than Downloads (such as your Documents folder or Desktop), make sure the specified folder is not an iCloud drive. Storing your Loop code in an iCloud drive folder will prevent Loop from building successfully. How do you know if a folder is an iCloud drive? Check your System Preferences. If your System Preferences for iCloud is set as shown below, your Documents and Desktop folders are iCloud drives and NOT appropriate places to save your Loop download. Depending on your browser and settings, your Loop download may or may not automatically unzip. If it does not unzip automatically, you can right-click on the zip file and choose to \"Open With\" Archive Utility. This will create a blue folder called Loop-master . HOWEVER, if you already have an existing Loop-master folder from a previous download, the name of the next download will be something like Loop-master (1) . The problem with that folder name is that it contains a space...and spaces in the name will cause your Loop build to fail. So, either delete old copies of Loop before downloading/unzipping or rename the folder(s) to ensure that NO SPACES are in the folder name. Add customizations \u2301 Add or redo any customizations, if needed. These will not be carried over automatically from the old app. Be sure to read up in the code customizations section before building, as there may be new customizations available since the previous build.

These links will always provide the most recent version of Loop: Loop: Master branch source code OR Loop: Dev branch source code FYI: The Loop source code resides in GitHub within a repository. A repository is kind of like a project's bookshelf, holding various books (aka branches) of a project. The master branch is considered a stable version. Any new features or options are first tested in a dev (short for \"development\") branch of the Loop. New or inexperienced users should not build from the dev branch of Loop. So if you hear of \"new features in dev\", these are things that may be eventually merged into the master branch once any bugs are worked out. IMPORTANT NOTES: Best practice is to leave your Loop source code in your Downloads folder. If you store your Loop code a different folder than Downloads (such as your Documents folder or Desktop), make sure the specified folder is not an iCloud drive. Storing your Loop code in an iCloud drive folder will prevent Loop from building successfully. How do you know if a folder is an iCloud drive? Check your System Preferences. If your System Preferences for iCloud is set as shown below, your Documents and Desktop folders are iCloud drives and NOT appropriate places to save your Loop download. Depending on your browser and settings, your Loop download may or may not automatically unzip. If it does not unzip automatically, you can right-click on the zip file and choose to \"Open With\" Archive Utility. This will create a blue folder called Loop-master . HOWEVER, if you already have an existing Loop-master folder from a previous download, the name of the next download will be something like Loop-master (1) . The problem with that folder name is that it contains a space...and spaces in the name will cause your Loop build to fail. So, either delete old copies of Loop before downloading/unzipping or rename the folder(s) to ensure that NO SPACES are in the folder name.","title":"Download new Loop source code"},{"location":"setup/update/updating/#add-customizations","text":"Add or redo any customizations, if needed.

Screenshots \u2301 Take a screenshot of your Loop main display screen , or other screens (such as Tuning results of RileyLink) that may help troubleshooters better understand your issue. A lot of times a picture is worth a thousand words. Being able to see recent Loop basal adjustments, predicted BG curve, and carb entries really helps fill in the full story of the current Loop status. If you didn't manage to get a screenshot when the issue was happening, you can also go to Nightscout and scroll back over the previous 48 hours to obtain much of the same information. Try to capture a Nightscout screen from the time period in question. Issue Report \u2301 Under the Loop app settings, there is a selection called Issue Report . Within the Issue Report is important information about your Loop's actions and status that can be very useful for troubleshooters...particularly with unexplained behaviors.

You will need to have your Preferred Data Source set to Event History for the automatic detection of primes to work. Reservoir Volumes will not detect prime events. If you are using a version of Loop older than v1.3.2 (or using Preferred Data Source of Reservoir Volume), you will need to be aware of the following regarding prime events at site changes: If you change sites and increase reservoir volume (i.e., start a new reservoir), don't worry. So long as you are putting in a reservoir that has more insulin than the old one, IOB will be accurate in Loop. When Loop sees a rewind and an increase in reservoir volume, it will not count any tubing primes as IOB. If you change sites but do NOT increase reservoir volume (i.e., you keep existing reservoir going), you will need to go into Loop's reservoir history and delete 30 minutes of continuous reservoir history including the prime event. By deleting 30 minutes of reservoir history, Loop will use Event History to determine insulin deliveries and IOB.

Use this section at your own risk. However, that said, some of the most common pump errors are repairable, or not actually a real problem. A21 error \u2301 This error message is common when a pump has been stored for a period of time without a battery. Most pumps will show an A21 error when you first purchase them on the used market. Not a big deal. Press the down arrow (also has the symbol of a light bulb on it) and the pump screen message will scroll down to let you know how to clear that error message (press ESC then ACT). If the message is coming up on a pump that hasn't been in storage, pull the battery out and replace with a fresh, new battery. Chances are your battery or battery cap are old. Look for signs of dirt or rust in the battery cap, give it a little cleaning. Display Tip When the pump screen has a little black/white bar on the right side, that is a scroll bar. Use the arrow keys on the right of the the pump screen to scroll and see the additional information. Batt Out Limit \u2301 This error message \"battery out of limits\" has to do with the internal pump battery, not the AAA battery you replace. The internal battery cannot be replaced, and unfortunately also has a finite lifespan. The error message is more of an annoyance than a true problem. You can try to change the AAA battery faster. But, the worst case scenario is that you'll have to re-enter the time and date when you get this message more often. (Don't forget to use RileyLink to set the time after you get this message.) Button Error \u2301 The Button Error message usually happens from water, moisture, or dust getting under the pump's button pad and causing button(s) to fail. The fix luckily is quite straight-forward and takes less than 30 minutes. Check out the fix here for a YouTube video or here for photo gallery The solution involves simply prying up the button pad's sticker face to expose the layers beneath. You can see some evidence of crud/rust on the underside of this button pad which caused the button error. After you finish your fix, another excellent idea is to make sure you add a length of clear packing tape across the front face of the pump to prevent errant water or dirt from having easy access to the button pad seams. Motor error \u2301 Often a motor error is the result of a poorly seated reservoir or tubing cap. If you get a motor error, the first thing you should do is detach from your infusion site. Remove and reseat the reservoir, prime again, and see if the motor error resolves. If it does not, try replacing the tubing cap on the reservoir (new tubing). If that does not resolve the motor error, also replace the entire reservoir. A33 error \u2301 Safety warning If you get this error, DO NOT push on the bulged out end cap. Always detach your tubing from your infusion set before addressing this error message. If you push on the end cap in an attempt to get it back flush, you may delivery a dangerous amount of insulin mistakenly. This error is a bit more involved to repair. The problem is that there is a loose drive support cap. Most of the time this error message will appear during a priming event as the end cap of the drive will slip, releasing the ability of the reservoir plunger to get pressure to delivery insulin. The pump senses the lack of pressure and delivers the A33 error. The solution is to UNHOOK from your site. See warning above. Remove reservoir and put your finger inside the reservoir sleeve. Push on the drive so that the end cap is pushed out the most possible. This will give your the most surface area possible to place the super glue GEL that you will use. (don't use regular super glue...it must be gel.) Remove the sticker that covers the end cap, save it for later because you can reattach when repair is completed. With the end cap pushed out, take some glue gel with the toothpick and apply it on the outside of the popped out cap . Be generous cause you can do this only once . Once you are done take a napkin and press hard the cap toward the pump so it can go back inside and keep it pressed for a few seconds. Then remove all the small parts of the napkin that has glued to the pump. Leave the pump to dry for about 10-15 minutes. Now to test whether the pumps was glued well. You have already waited about 10-15 minutes so put your finger back in and press hard the plunger. If you glued it well, the end cap will not move. If the cap goes out again, you have to glue one more time. If all looks well, put some glue back on top of the pump cap and reattach the sticker that was removed to start. A32 and E22 error loop \u2301 From what we know, this set of error codes seems like a pump killer. A call to Medtronic support gave this less than hopeful information: A32 - failure of flash memory E22 - software re-installation is necessary We don't have any reports of a good fix for these error codes. When seen, usually the E22 error comes up and as soon as it is cleared, the A32 errror comes up.

Then remove all the small parts of the napkin that has glued to the pump. Leave the pump to dry for about 10-15 minutes. Now to test whether the pumps was glued well. You have already waited about 10-15 minutes so put your finger back in and press hard the plunger. If you glued it well, the end cap will not move. If the cap goes out again, you have to glue one more time. If all looks well, put some glue back on top of the pump cap and reattach the sticker that was removed to start.","title":"A33 error"},{"location":"troubleshooting/pump-errors/#a32-and-e22-error-loop","text":"From what we know, this set of error codes seems like a pump killer.

Numerous factors can influence how well those communications can function...interferences from other devices, temperature, physical blocking, etc. Knowing a little about the strength of the radio communications will help you troubleshoot Loop errors. When you Tune Radio Frequency in the Riley Link menu, it is testing for the strongest frequency to communicate with the pump. Usually this frequency is pretty constant, but during temperature changes it may be that the best frequency is not the one currently set. The tuning results also show which frequency is the strongest. For example, in the screenshot below, the strength of the radio communications with the pump is shown by the last number of the tune. Frequencies with tuning results of -99 means NO communications were established at that frequency. RileyLink will use the strongest frequency tune for its pump communications. In the screenshot, the best frequency returned a result of -37 at a frequency of 916.60 MHz , so RileyLink will set that 916.60 MHz for its pump communications. Generally, if you have tuning in the -90s, your RileyLink-pump communications will not work. If you have tuning in the -80s, you may have periodic communication failures. If your tuning is in the -70s or better, your communications should be pretty stable. Experiment with your RileyLink by moving it closer and farther away from the pump. Try putting it on the other side of your body, or put it in a purse. Test the tuning results in real world situations that you think you'd be encountering, such as where you will have the RileyLink placed during overnight charging. Perform tunes at the various distances and situations. This will help you understand how far from the pump your RileyLink can get before it will affect Loop performance. Bluetooth \u2301 RileyLink communicates with your iPhone and Loop app through Bluetooth (BT). If your iPhone has BT issues, your Loop will have failures. There have been reports of BT audio devices (such as BT pairings in your car or home audio BT speakers) interfering with the Loop. If you are finding Loop failures frequently happening at a particular location, you may try to troubleshoot if there are BT problems in the area. Your BT signal strength can be seen in the Loop settings, under the RileyLink menu, on the Signal Strength line. As you move closer and further away from your phone, you can watch that number dynamically change. This line is not displaying the signal strength of your pump communications discussed above (those are shown in the tuning results screen). Lights \u2301 RileyLink has several lights that you may notice from time to time. There is no 'power' light. If you suspect that your RileyLink is not being powered, try turning it off and on using the small sliding switch. You should see lights in the middle of the board flash when you do this. If they flash, that means the board has power. Red light: Charging light. The red light will remain on while RileyLink is charging, and it will turn off when charging is complete. You may notice the red light turn on periodically even after charging is complete...it's just \"topping off\". Green light: Bluetooth connection light. The green light will remain on while you have BT connection with your iPhone. If that green light fails to stay on, you should troubleshoot your BT connections. Try restarting BT on your iPhone and/or turning the RileyLink off/on by its power switch. Blue light: Pump communications. If you have an older firmware on your RileyLink, some of the blue lights will flash periodically as it is communicating with the pump. It's just letting you know that it is busy talking and collecting info. You will also see increased blue flashes if you have \"Enabled Diagnositic LEDs\" for RileyLinks that have the updated firmware (shipping since late August 2018). A solid blue light that consistenly remains lit on the board could mean one of two things: A temporary issue that can be resolved by rebooting the RileyLink physically (turning the switch off/on), or An electrical short or damage to the board. Sweat and moisture are most likely culprits, so try to keep case free from those environments (don't keep in sports bras or waist band next to skin, for example, while exercising) If your blue light remains on despite trying a restart, it is time to pull out your backup RileyLink. Charging \u2301 The battery that comes with RileyLink is not likely charged completely when it is shipped, so feel free to charge it up. You'll need a mini-USB cable and 0.5A USB charging power supply like your iPhone power supply. RileyLink takes about 2-4 hours to fully charge (the red light will turn off when fully charged, read note above about red light patterns) and should easily last at least a full day of constant Loop use. Typically, it can go into the 30-hour range without problem. Most people charge their RileyLink each night when they are sleeping. You don't have to worry about leaving the RileyLink plugged in \"too long\" for charging. It will automatically stop charging the battery when it is fully charged. Since the best practice is to charge your RileyLink overnight while you sleep, and the battery lasts safely over 24 hours, there is no battery level indicator for the RileyLink. The RileyLink's charge level is not viewable on Nightscout, nor within the Loop app. If you forget to charge your RileyLink overnight, you can recharge it with a portable USB battery in a pinch. A short mini-USB cable could be a good addition to a small gear bag. Range \u2301 The range that your RileyLink will function is heavily dependent on the environment that you are in. Read the section about Tuning to help determine how far your RileyLink can dependably maintain an adequate signal strength in your particular environment. Most people wear the RileyLink in a pocket or carry a belt holster during the day. Typically, RileyLink will need to be closer to the pump than the iPhone. The radio frequency communications will have a shorter range than the BT communications. Lipo Battery \u2301 If you ordered your RileyLink preassembled, you should plug in the battery cable. Please make sure your RileyLink\u2019s battery cable is securely pushed all the way into the socket. Poor battery cable connection can make the Loop communications fail. RileyLink with loose battery cable. RileyLink with properly secured battery cable. Keep your RileyLink and lipo battery protected from damage. Lipo batteries are unsafe when damaged or punctured, so the case is an important part of safe Looping. If your battery is damaged in some way, please disconnect it immediately, and dispose of it (they should be recycled). You can order new batteries on the GetRileyLink website Removing Lipo Battery \u2301 To remove the lipo battery from the RileyLink, please do so slowly and patiently. Work the battery connection side to side slowly to loosen it from the plug. Some people have reported success using small, curved needle nose pliers such as hemostats. Others have used small flathead screwdrivers as shown in this video .","title":"RileyLink"},{"location":"troubleshooting/rileylink/#rileylink","text":"","title":"RileyLink"},{"location":"troubleshooting/rileylink/#tuning-the-radio","text":"The RileyLink communicates with the pump through radio frequency communications.

To stay green, there are several things that Loop must do: Loop obtains a BG value from your CGM source, and Loop reads your pump history to know about insulin deliveries and recent events, and Loop completes a run of its calculations based on those inputs Loop recommends a temp basal and sends that instruction to the pump Pump enacts the recommended temp basal Loop confirms the pump enacted the recommended temp basal If something goes wrong in those steps and more than 5 minutes goes by, the Loop will turn yellow until it can solve the problem. If more than 15 minutes goes by and the problem still exists, Loop will turn red. To see the latest Loop error messages, touch the yellow or red Loop Status circle on the main screen. If an error message is available, it will appear in a dialog window. Use that error message to help guide your next troubleshooting steps, as laid out in the discussion below. A healthy green loop will have timestamps less than 5 minutes old below the green loop, BG reading, and reservoir level. This indicates that the Loop was run less than 5 minutes ago, fresh BGs have been coming in, temp basals have been enacted by the pump, and the pump is communicating with Loop. The screenshot below is a very happy Loop. For Loopers who have already been successfully getting green loops, but suddenly find themselves with problems...we need to figure out which area your loop is failing in. The displayed error message should help you narrow in on the cause of the red loop: Is this a CGM issue? Is this a pump issue? Is this a RileyLink/BT issue? CGM issues \u2301 Old BG data (CGM issue) \u2301 If your Loop turns yellow or red, easiest to start by checking the timestamps on the BG. If the BG reading is more than 5 minutes older than your iPhone time, your Loop will not be green. The screenshot below is a good example of missing BG data preventing the Loop from staying green. The pump is still communicating (reservoir reading is only 2 minutes old)...BGs appear to be the problem. BG troubleshooting steps: Verify you have enabled the correct CGM Selection in Loop settings; it is easy to accidentally change the selection while scrolling through the settings page For G5, verify your transmitter ID is set correctly in Loop settings For G4, verify the Dexcom Share app is running on your phone Fetch Recent Glucose command in RL only works for Medtronic CGM users, by the way...so don't expect that command to solve Dexcom CGM issues If your local CGM is working fine on the Dexcom app, but Loop isn't reading it: make sure you enter your Dexcom Share account info in the Loop settings. Loop will automatically switch to pulling from the Dexcom servers if the local reading isn't working. try turning Loop and Dexcom apps off, toggle BT off/on, restart Loop app, and then restart Dexcom app Pump Issues \u2301 Old Pump data (Pump Issue) \u2301 If your pump reading is older than 5 minutes, but BGs are fine, then you will need to troubleshoot the pump communications. The screenshot below is a good example of missing pump data preventing the Loop from staying green. The CGM is still communicating (BG reading is only 2 minutes old)...but pump reservoir reading is older than 5 min. Pump troubleshooting steps: Your pump battery may be low. Replace the battery...even if the percentage doesn't look low, this is a good starting point If you have an x23 or x54 model pump, make sure your mysentry is paired Have the pump and RL gotten too far away from each other? Try bringing them closer Try retuning the RL. Just a note though, the Loop has code embedded to automatically retunes RL when the pump comms are failing for 20 minutes. So, manual retuning is more about speeding things along rather than being a necessary intervention to fixing pump comms. Try a Send Button Press to \"wake up the pump\" a bit. Try a Fetch Pump History . Same as retuning though, the Loop has code embedded to automatically pull pump history. Manual fetching of pump history is more about speeding things along than being a necessary step to fixing pump comms. If you have a backup pump, try switching to that pump and see whether the issue persists. About Pump Communications Pump communications errors can and will happen. Just be patient, and they almost always correct themselves. Yellow loops happen sometimes, and aren't usually worth troubleshooting. Red loops are more infrequent and usually a good time to start investigating possible source. Some environments will be noisy for rf comms (such as concerts, amusement parks, tech venues, conferences with OpenAPS users in attendance, etc.), and your loop may not stay green as often as usual. Just be patient. When you leave that environment, looping will go back to normal. Wireless microphones, baby monitors, and other similar types of devices can interfer with pump communications if there are lots of competing radio devices in a tight environment. If you find you have areas of your house that consistently have poor pump communications, look for potential sources of interference from wireless devices. Another common area for failed pump communications are at night if you tend to sleep on your pump, or otherwise \"body block\" the RL's ability to communicate with the pump. Try to place your pump and RL such that your body will not block the signal to/from RL. Standing the RL on it's base with antenna pointing up, on a nearby nightstand should be sufficient proximity/orientation for overnight looping. These examples below are pump error messages. Notice they all mention the pump specifically. Incorrect Pump Time (Pump Issue) \u2301 And here's an interesting problem. BGs are current, but notice that the pump time is 2 hours into the future of the current iPhone time. In this case, the Loop user had manually set their pump time during travels and caused the pump time to be out of sync with Loop. Remember, do not change your pump time manually...always use the RL to set the pump time . This red loop was resolved as soon as the Looper used RL to set the pump time. Failure to Enact Temp Basals (Pump Issue) \u2301 If you see messages about \"Could not verify TempBasal on attempt 2\", that is likely one of just a few issues. The message indicates that Loop has BGs and pump data, has sent a recommended basal to the pump, but the pump does not appear to be enacting those basals. Your pump cannot be suspended. Resume insulin deliveries Max basal rate in Loop app cannot be greater than max basal rate in pump settings Temp basal type must be set to unit/hour, not percent, in pump Bluetooth/RL issues \u2301 Bluetooth failures (RL or iPhone issue) \u2301 Sometimes the RilleyLink and iPhone fail to communicate via BT. You need to determine if this is due to RL's problems, iPhone's problems, or just BT communications problem. There can be messages when BT fails, such as the message below, or \"RileyLink Timeout\" error messages. Has your RL been fully charged? Try charging your RL for an hour or two, make sure the red light comes on while charging Is your lipo battery old and perhaps dying earlier in the day? Order a new battery, replace lipo battery Check your lipo battery wires? If your wires are dislodged from the lipo itself, RL will not likely work for long Your RL battery needs to be securely plugged in, check those connections. Check if your RL is on and says \"connected\" in the status screen for bluetooth . If it says \"connecting\" or \"disconnected\", you have a BT problem with RL and iPhone. Make sure your iPhone's BT is turned on, and BT is not being affected by other BT systems (such as car audio) Check if any of the RL command buttons work...such as Send Button Press . If you've checked all of the above, toggle your RL power switch and turn your iPhone BT off/on. Try rebooting your phone. If those steps don't work and the RL is properly charging otherwise, likely you have a bad RileyLink and will need to replace it. Loop Settings Issues \u2301 Failure to set Insulin Curve Model (Loop settings) \u2301 If you see messages about \"Missing data: Glucose effects\", you likely have forgotten to set your Insulin Curve Model . The message indicates that Loop is missing a component of its algorithm inputs to calculate glucose effects on predicted BGs.

You need to determine if this is due to RL's problems, iPhone's problems, or just BT communications problem. There can be messages when BT fails, such as the message below, or \"RileyLink Timeout\" error messages. Has your RL been fully charged? Try charging your RL for an hour or two, make sure the red light comes on while charging Is your lipo battery old and perhaps dying earlier in the day? Order a new battery, replace lipo battery Check your lipo battery wires? If your wires are dislodged from the lipo itself, RL will not likely work for long Your RL battery needs to be securely plugged in, check those connections. Check if your RL is on and says \"connected\" in the status screen for bluetooth . If it says \"connecting\" or \"disconnected\", you have a BT problem with RL and iPhone. Make sure your iPhone's BT is turned on, and BT is not being affected by other BT systems (such as car audio) Check if any of the RL command buttons work...such as Send Button Press . If you've checked all of the above, toggle your RL power switch and turn your iPhone BT off/on. Try rebooting your phone. If those steps don't work and the RL is properly charging otherwise, likely you have a bad RileyLink and will need to replace it.","title":"Bluetooth failures (RL or iPhone issue)"},{"location":"troubleshooting/yellow-red-loop/#loop-settings-issues","text":"","title":"Loop Settings Issues"},{"location":"troubleshooting/yellow-red-loop/#failure-to-set-insulin-curve-model-loop-settings","text":"If you see messages about \"Missing data: Glucose effects\", you likely have forgotten to set your Insulin Curve Model .
