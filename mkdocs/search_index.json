            "text": "General\n\n\nLoop has both Hardware and Software requirements.  In general, to use Loop you need to have six components.\n\n\nCompatible insulin pump\nCompatible CGM\nRileyLink\nCompatible iPhone/iPod Touch\nApple computer running Mac OS X 10.11.5 or later\nXcode (a free Apple application)\n\n\nYou will need to be able to install software on your computer and possibly sign up as an Apple Developer to install the Loop app to your iPhone.  For the most part, if you are comfortable with installing software programs on your computer, you will have no problem building and running Loop. There are detailed step-by-step instructions included in this guide.  You should be doing this yourself so you can understand how to fix it WHEN it breaks. You may want to help another person get set up on Loop, and that is noble, but you will serve them much better if you support them doing the work themselves, rather than doing it for them.\n\n\nHardware\n\n\n\nThe following information is a listing of compatible hardware used with Loop.  \n\n\nInsulin Pump (Required)\n\n\nThere are a number of insulin pumps manufactured between 2006 \u2013 2012 by Medtronic which are compatible.  Compatibility has two requirements; (1) pump model and (2) firmware.\n\n\nThe Loop-compatible pumps are as follows:\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \nInsulin Pump\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nMM 515/715\n2\n\n      \nMM 522/722\n2\n\n      \nMM 523/723\n3\n\n      \nMM 554/754\n3\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n      \nCGM\n\n      \nDexcom G4\n1\n \n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nDexcom G5\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nMM CGM\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n. Offline access to glucose requires a Receiver with Share and the \nShare2 app\n to be running on the same device. Internet-dependent access via Share servers is also supported.\n\n2\n. Pump must have a remote ID added in the \nRemote Options\n menu.\n\n3\n. Early firmware (US \n= 2.4A, AU/EUR \n= 2.6A) is required for using Closed Loop and Bolus features.\n\n\nAll pumps MUST have a Remote ID added in the pump settings, any group of numbers will do. For x22 pumps use Main Menu -\n Utilities -\n Remote Options -\n On -\n Add ID, while for x23 pumps use Main Menu -\n Utilities -\n Connect Devices -\n Remotes -\n On -\n Add ID. 723/523/754/554 pumps should also be configured with MySentry. MySentry pairing is accomplished by following the instructions at Loop settings -\n RileyLink -\n MySentry Pair while this screen is being displayed.\n\n\nWhat model is my pump?\n\n\nTo determine your pump model, look at the back side of your pump.  There should be a sticker on the underside of the pump.  On the right hand side of the sticker it says REF MMT-XXXXXX\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above it says the pump model is:  MMT-722NAS\n\n\nMMT         Pump Manufacturer Model (MiniMed Medtronic)\n722         Pump Model Number\nNA          Pump Region (NA=North America, CA=Canada/Australia, WW=Worldwide)\nS           Pump Color (S=Smoke, L=Clear/Lucite, B=Blue, P=Pink/Purple)\n\n\n\n(Some pumps may have an \u201cL\u201d or \u201cS\u201d before the NA, e.g. a model number like MMT-LNAS.  There is at least one report of successful looping with an LNAS pump, so as far as we know LNA is equivalent to NA here, but data are limited at present.)\n\n\nThe difference between the Medtronic 500 series and the 700 series pumps is the size of the insulin reservoirs.  The 500 series pumps use a 180 unit reservoir, and the 700 series pumps use a 300 unit reservoir (or smaller 180 unit reservoir if you want).\n\n\nThe difference between the Medtronic x22 pumps and the x23 pumps is primarily three features.  The x23 pumps will allow for basal and bolus increments of 0.025 units, whereas the x22 pumps have larger increments of 0.05 units.  Loop will have the bolus delivery automatically rounded by the pump to the units available in the pump model, and any smaller adjustments (to make up for the rounding) will be made through Loop\u2019s use of temp basals.  Additionally, because of the way Loop fetches information from the pump, the x23 series of pumps are slightly better at conserving battery life through the use of the MySentry.  x22 pumps do not use MySentry.  The x23 series pumps are also somewhat faster at delivering large boluses (up to several times faster for boluses \n 10 units).\n\n\nWhat Is my pump\u2019s firmware?\n\n\nA pump\u2019s firmware is the internal software that runs your pump.  Older Medtronic firmware allows Loop to act as a \u201cremote control\u201d to set temp basals and report back pump data.  Newer firmware disabled that \u201cremote control\u201d access and therefore cannot be used with these DIY APS systems.  There is currently no ability to downgrade a pump\u2019s firmware or replace it with older firmware.  So before you buy a used pump, make sure you are getting one with compatible firmware.\n\n\nTo find your pump\u2019s firmware you will need to power it up.  If the pump has not been powered on for some time (i.e., has been in storage without a battery for awhile), it will run through a start-up count and the firmware version will appear on the bottom right of the pump\u2019s screen.  Don\u2019t turn away, as the Version number will only be displayed for a little while before the screen moves onto other information displays.  \n\n\nIf the pump has been active recently or has a reservoir installed, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n\nPress the \n button on your pump.\n\n\nScroll down with the \n button to the bottom of the status display.\n\n\nRead the bottom line of the display.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous Glucose Monitor (Required)\n\n\nA continuous glucose monitor (CGM) provides Loop with current blood glucose readings (every 5 minutes, in the case of Dexcom).  These readings allow Loop to predict what the current glucose trend is, and predict the future glucose based on carbohydrate input and basal profiles. The following are the types of CGMs compatible with Loop.\n\n\nDexcom G5 CGM \n\n\nDexcom G5 receives CGM data directly to the iPhone via bluetooth and the Dexcom G5 Mobile app on your iPhone.  It does not require the use of a G5 stand-alone receiver.  With a Dexcom G5 system, Loop can be run offline (i.e., without internet access but still needs bluetooth on).\n\n\nDexcom G4 CGM with Share Receiver \n\n\nDexcom G4 transmits CGM data to a Dexcom G4 Share Receiver.  The receiver, in turn, connects to the Dexcom Share2 app on your iPhone via Bluetooth.  The Share2 app uploads CGM data to the Dexcom servers.  With a Dexcom G4 Share system, Loop can be run offline.\n\n\nMedtronic CGM \n\n\nThe Minimed Enlite CGM, available with the Medtronic 523/723 and 554/754, wirelessly sends blood glucose readings to the pump.  Loop can read the Medtronic CGM data directly from the pump using the RileyLink.  This solution can be used with Loop offline.\n\n\nRileyLink (Required) \n\n\nThe RileyLink is an open-source hardware device that can bridge Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to 916MHz wireless communication. What does that mean to you? It means RileyLink is the communication highway between your insulin pump and iPhone.\n\n\n\n\nThe RileyLink is available as a set of PCB files and software, with instructions on how to build your own RileyLink hardware module.  All this can be found here: \nRileyLink Github\n\nIf you aren\u2019t up to the task of building your own RileyLink (and most of us aren\u2019t), community members periodically do a production run of RileyLinks. You can place an order here: \nRileyLink order site\n\n\nApple iPhone (Required)\n\n\nLoop will run on on any iPhone that is running iOS 10.0 or later. iPhones version 6 and up seem to have better bluetooth reliability.\n\n\nApple Watch (Not Required)\n\n\nLoop is currently supported with all released versions of the Apple Watch and Apple Watch OS3.  Cool factor is increased since the T1D can directly enter carbs and boluses straight from the watch, without needing to access the iPhone.\n\n\nThe status screen is shown in the left image and includes loop status, time since last loop, blood glucose and predicted eventual blood glucose.  Carb and bolus screen as indicated on the picture can be accessed by force touching the watch (press hard).   A loop complication exists to show BG on the watchface but the update rate is limited to ~30mins due to limitations imposed by apple to increase battery life. If constant real time monitoring is desired it is recommended to use the loop app as the main screen. This can be achieved by setting the watch to always show last opened app on wake. Loop will always have to be the last app opened for this to work.\n\n\nIf you add an apple watch after building loop you will need to pair your watch to your phone and then rebuild loop to enable the loop watch app to show up as an available watch app.\n\n\n\n\nApple Computer Running OS X 10.11.5 or later (Required)\n\n\nTo build and install Loop onto your iPhone, you will need access to an Apple computer running OS X 10.11.5 or later.   \u201cEl Capitan\u201d is OS X 10.11.  \u201cSierra\u201d is the newly released OS X 10.12.  Access is only required when you are initially installing the Loop app, updating to a newer release, or making changes to the underlying Loop code.  You do NOT need access to an Apple computer in order to troubleshoot or change Loop settings, such as basal profiles or carb ratios.\n\n\nWhere can you find your computer\u2019s OS X version?  Click on the Apple icon in the upper left corner of your Mac\u2019s display.  Select \u201cAbout This Mac\u201d from the dropdown menu, and it will display the OS X version number.\n\n\n\n\nSoftware, Licenses, and Services\n\n\nThe following software, licenses, and services are used to manage, build, compile, deploy, and log data about Loop running on your iPhone.   Not all of the items listed in this section are required, but they may improve your Loop experience This is a list of the software tools and where you can get more information about them.  Installation and configuration of the required tools is in Section 4 of this document.\n\n\nGitHub Access (Required)\n\n\nSo the most obvious thing you will need to run Loop is the \u201csource code\u201d itself.  The code resides on \nGitHub\n. You\u2019ll be downloading the Loop code from GitHub so that you can use it on your computer.  Section 4.1.3 describes how to do that. You will need to make sure you are using a computer and internet access that allows for downloading from GitHub.\n\n\nXCode (Required)\n\n\nTo build and install Loop on your iPhone, you are going to use the XCode application on your Apple computer.  XCode is available for free from the \nApple App Store\n.  Go ahead, download it!\n\n\nXCode 8.2.1 is the most recent version.  If your iPhone is running iOS 10.1, you must use XCode 8.1 or newer. Xcode 8.2.1 requires an Apple computer running OSX Sierra, or OS X El Capitan 10.11.5 or later.\n\n\nLegacy versions:\n\n\n\n\nXCode 8.0 can also be used to build Loop.  XCode 8.0 will only work with iPhones using iOS 10.0 or earlier.  Xcode 8.0, similar to XCode 8.1, requires an Apple computer running OSX Sierra, or OS X El Capitan 10.11.5 or later.  You should use the Master branch of Loop v1.1 to build with XCode 8.0.\n\n\nXCode 7.3 can be used but only up to Loop v0.13.  Subsequent versions of Loop require a more current version of XCode.  \n\n\n\n\nApple Developer Program Enrollment (Not Required, but HIGHLY recommended)\n\n\nOH, how exciting is this part?  You are on the way to being an official Apple Developer.  Being an Apple Developer allows you to \u201csign\u201d the application software.  Signing tells the iPhone that the software is from a trusted source and keeps your iPhone (a little bit) safer.  Apps won\u2019t run without signing.\n\n\nIf you choose NOT to enroll in the \nApple Developer Program\n, Apple only lets you sign and develop an app for 7 days.  After that, Apple expires the app and it will need to be resigned and reinstalled in order to begin working again.  What does that mean for you?  Reinstalling your Loop app EVERY 7 DAYS to keep it working.  Sound like a royal pain in the butt?  It is.\n\n\nIf you enroll in the Apple Developer Program, the cost is $99 annually.  And your Loop won\u2019t expire for a full year.  THIS IS THE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED OPTION.\n\n\nGitter (Not Required, but Highly Recommended) \n\n\nGitter is an instant messaging/chat platform for software developers and users.  It is the easiest place to seek assistance with Loop.  To use Gitter, go to https://gitter.im/LoopKit/Loop and login with either a GitHub or Twitter account. This should be where you go for questions about your setup process.  If you\u2019re too nervous to ask, you can use the search function on Gitter to look if your question may have been answered recently as well.  However, it\u2019s a friendly group and questions are welcome.  There is a facebook group for loop (Looped)  but technical issues should primarily be resolved in the Gitter room.",

Let\u2019s put that Loop on your iPhone.\n\n\nSetup your Apple Computer\n\n\nInstall XCode\n\n\nDid you go to the \nApple App Store\n? It\u2019s an application on your Apple Computer.  Open it and search for XCode.  Download and install it for free.  Easy peasy.  Except it takes about 20-40 minutes to download depending on your internet speed.\n\n\n\n\nInstall Carthage\n\n\nThe installation of Carthage has a few different ways it can be done, but the easiest is to download the Carthage package here:\n\n\nCarthage.pkg download\n       \n\n\nDouble-click on the download and follow the directions to install (basically give your computer\u2019s password and it does the rest).  Done.  Nothing more needs to happen with Carthage (it runs in the background).\n\n\nIF you have problems with that method, you can use the \u201cHomebrew method\u201d.  And here\u2019s how it is done:\nOpen the Terminal application on your Apple computer (it is located in the Utilities application folder)\n\n\nCopy and paste the line below into the prompt in Terminal.  Press return after you paste it in.\n\n\n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\n\nThere will be a prompt asking if you want to continue (press return to continue, then it may prompt for your password.  enter your computer user password.).  Wait while the script does its thing...you\u2019ll see info scroll by and then it will pause for awhile.  Eventually, it will be done and you\u2019ll see something that says \u201cInstallation successful\u201d and you\u2019ll have a ready terminal prompt again.\n\n\nType \nbrew update\n and press return.\n\n\nType \nbrew install carthage\n (without the quotes) and press return.\n\n\nYou can close the Terminal application now.  You\u2019re done with it.  Phew.\n\n\n\n\nDownload Loop Source Code\n\n\nYou\u2019ll need to obtain the Loop\u2019s source code in order to build the app on your computer.  There are various ways of doing that; from super easy to more advanced. Pick whichever method you are comfortable with.  The first two options do not require a GitHub account.  The last option will require you to have a GitHub account.\n\n\n{Note: What\u2019s the disadvantage of the Super Easy option below?  Any customizations you do in XCode will remain on your local computer only.  If Loop\u2019s source code updates to a new version, you will have to re-enter your customizations if/when you decide to update your Loop to subsequent versions.  However, most customizations are probably going to be fairly quick and easy to redo, just like they were the first time.}\n\n\nDirect Download (Super Easy)\n\n\nIf you click on the link below, a copy of the Loop source code\u2019s master branch will be downloaded to your downloads folder.\n\n\nLoop Master branch\n\n\nClone with Terminal (Sorta easy)\n\n\nOpen Terminal Application, copy and paste the line below.  This will download a clone of the master branch to your root directory of your computer user account:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/LoopKit/Loop.git\n\n\nGitHub Desktop, Fork and Pull the Repo (Advanced)\n\n\nLogin to your GitHub account and fork a copy of the \nLoop repository\n.  \n\n\nSetup a sync between your GitHub repository and your computer by installing \nGithub Desktop\n onto your computer.\n\n\nGo back to your Loop repository in GitHub and press the green \u201cClone or download\u201d button and choose \u201copen in desktop\u201d.  You will now have a copy of the selected branch in stored in your local folder.  \n\n\n\n\nYou can later go into the GitHub desktop client and commit your changes, change branches, etc as you test various configurations.  See Section 4.3.6 for further information about how to commit those changes back to your repository.\n\n\nInstall Loop using XCode\n\n\nHere\u2019s where the fun really begins.  You\u2019re about to build your Loop app.\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve used the direct download option (super easy), go to your Downloads folder, open the Loop folder, and double click on Loop.xcodeproj.  \n\n\n\n\nIf you used another option, find the Loop folder on your computer and double click on Loop.xcodeproj\n\n\nA warning may appear asking if you really want to open it, click Open.  XCode will open the project, and take a few moments to organize the files.\n\n\n\n\nOnce XCode has finished indexing, the Loop project will appear in the far left column.  Click on the blue Loop icon, and then click on the file called Loop.xcconfig.  The middle portion of XCode window will populate and this is where you will find the MAIN_APP_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER. The default is com.loopkit \n\n\n\n\nYou need to change the MAIN_APP_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER  to your own unique identifier.  Keep it in the reverse-domain syntax, meaning start with \u201ccom.\u201d (no quotes though).  After you enter your new MAIN_APP_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER, save the project using Command-S, and then click on the blue \u201cLoop\u201d file in the far left column.\n\n\n\n\nThe next steps are to \u201csign\u201d the application so that Apple will allow its use on the iPhone.  You will need to select a \u201cteam\u201d.  If you already have a team from previous XCode projects, you may see teams listed.  Use the dropdown menu to select the appropriate team.  Make sure you keep the \u201cautomatically manage signing\u201d box checked.  \n\n\nIf, however, this is your first time signing an app in XCode, your screen may instead look like the screen to the right.  In which case, you will need to add a developer account (either free or paid) by clicking on \u201cAdd Account\u201d.  \n\n\n\n\n\u201cAdd Account\u201d will open the XCode preferences window, as shown below.  You will need to sign in with your Apple ID (or create one, if you don\u2019t already have one).\n\n\n\n\nOnce you get signed in, your apple ID will appear under the Accounts section as shown below.  Close that window by pressing the little red circle in the upper left corner, and you will return to the main XCode screen again.\n\n\nNote: You may need to close Xcode and restart to see your Apple account for signing to appear in the Signing section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeginning of SIDE NOTE about signing and Provisioning Profiles.\n\n\nThe 7-day free Provisioning Profiles are signed from \u201c(Personal Team)\u201d.\n\n\nThe full-year paid Provisioning Profiles do NOT have \u201c(Personal Team)\u201d\n\n\n\n\nMany people think \u201cHey I\u2019ll try to build this Loop for free and if I like it, then I\u2019ll buy the $99 Apple Developer license.\u201d  If that\u2019s you right now, please come back here when you are ready to reinstall as a paid developer account.  You will need to: \n\n\n\n\nSelect the correct team because now there will be two to choose from.  Use the one without the \u201c(Personal Team)\u201d to build apps that last a full 12 months.\n\n\nWhen you rebuild your app, choose a new MAIN_APP_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER different than your previous one.  For example, if you used \u201ccom.yourname\u201d on the free app then choose \u201ccom.yourname2\u201d for the new paid app.  \n\n\nYou will have to re-enter your Loop settings on your new app once it is installed (hopefully, you took written notes of them from when you were running your free app..hint hint).\n\n\n\n\nEnd of SIDE NOTE\n\n\n\n\nWhen you return to the main screen, select your team name and you may see two status warnings.  The first warning may appear if you do not have an iPhone plugged into the Mac.  The \u201cfailed to create a provisioning profile\u201d has details that should alert you to plug in your device (iPhone).  Once you connect your iPhone via cable to the Mac, select your iPhone from the hidden drop down list (see red arrow below).  Your device\u2019s personal name should be at the top of the list.  Select your personal device. You may need to \u201cregister the device\u201d if this is your first time using Xcode with that iphone, follow the prompt if that\u2019s the case.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you select your device, XCode should resolve the warnings and generate a Provisioning Profile.  If you click on the information icon (little \u201ci\u201d in the circle), for the Provisioning Profile, you can verify the signing date and mark your calendar for rebuilding in 7 days if you are using a free Apple Developer account.  If you are enrolled in the Apple Developer Program (aka paid the $99), the expiration date will be for a year from the creation date.\n\n\nFinally, you need to make sure to sign all FOUR \u201ctargets\u201d to the application; Loop, Loop Status Extension, WatchApp, and WatchApp Extension.  So far, we have only signed the Loop target.  Click on the blue \u201cLoop\u201d on the left and then the box with the vertical line to drop down the targets list.  Choose each of the remaining three targets and then select the signing team that you selected previously in the Loop target signing. Make sure you have signed all four targets.  If the \u201cloopkit\u201d still appears on the Bundle Identifier line, don\u2019t worry about it.  Xcode will update that to your chosen MAIN_APP name when it builds.  Sometimes Xcode is just slow to rename.  Just leave that Bundle Identifier line untouched.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point in the process, you should make any custom configurations to your Loop app before you finish with the installation of Loop on your iPhone.  If you want to make any of the customizations yourself, the step-by-step instructions are provided.  When you\u2019ve completed those customizations, please return here and follow the next steps to finish the installation of Loop.\n\n\n\n\nAll done with customizations? Let\u2019s finish the installation of the Loop app onto your iPhone.  Select your device and then press the \u201cplay\u201d button (or build button) to start XCode on its way.  [You may be prompted to add the iPhone to your Developer Account...go ahead and do so.]  You\u2019ll see the progression of the build in the status window.  If the build is successful, it will say \u201cfinished running Loop\u201d in the status bar.  If the build fails, it will show you red error alerts and you can read what the failure was.  Yellow error alerts do not cause the build to fail, those are just warnings.\n\n\n\n\nIf this is the first time you have installed an app on your iPhone using your Developer Account, you may get a warning like this.  Just follow the directions in the warning, and the issue resolves very quickly.  Click ok and you can safely disconnect your iPhone from the computer.  (If you don\u2019t get a warning and the Loop app installs but does not open, you may still need to go to Settings-\nGeneral-\nDevice Management and enable trust for your Developer Account.)\n\n\n\n\nYou can confirm Loop has installed on your phone simply by looking on the iphone.  Turn it on and check if the Loop app is running, or locating the Loop app icon.  If you don\u2019t see it, try pressing the build (play) button again.  There should be a message at the top of Xcode window indicating a successful build.  Once you get confirmation and can see Loop on your iPhone, you can simply unplug from computer.  \n\n\nCONGRATS!  YOU JUST INSTALLED LOOP!\n\n\n...",

Close that window by pressing the little red circle in the upper left corner, and you will return to the main XCode screen again.  Note: You may need to close Xcode and restart to see your Apple account for signing to appear in the Signing section.    Beginning of SIDE NOTE about signing and Provisioning Profiles.  The 7-day free Provisioning Profiles are signed from \u201c(Personal Team)\u201d.  The full-year paid Provisioning Profiles do NOT have \u201c(Personal Team)\u201d   Many people think \u201cHey I\u2019ll try to build this Loop for free and if I like it, then I\u2019ll buy the $99 Apple Developer license.\u201d  If that\u2019s you right now, please come back here when you are ready to reinstall as a paid developer account.  You will need to:    Select the correct team because now there will be two to choose from.  Use the one without the \u201c(Personal Team)\u201d to build apps that last a full 12 months.  When you rebuild your app, choose a new MAIN_APP_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER different than your previous one.  For example, if you used \u201ccom.yourname\u201d on the free app then choose \u201ccom.yourname2\u201d for the new paid app.    You will have to re-enter your Loop settings on your new app once it is installed (hopefully, you took written notes of them from when you were running your free app..hint hint).   End of SIDE NOTE   When you return to the main screen, select your team name and you may see two status warnings.  The first warning may appear if you do not have an iPhone plugged into the Mac.  The \u201cfailed to create a provisioning profile\u201d has details that should alert you to plug in your device (iPhone).  Once you connect your iPhone via cable to the Mac, select your iPhone from the hidden drop down list (see red arrow below).  Your device\u2019s personal name should be at the top of the list.  Select your personal device. You may need to \u201cregister the device\u201d if this is your first time using Xcode with that iphone, follow the prompt if that\u2019s the case.   Once you select your device, XCode should resolve the warnings and generate a Provisioning Profile.  If you click on the information icon (little \u201ci\u201d in the circle), for the Provisioning Profile, you can verify the signing date and mark your calendar for rebuilding in 7 days if you are using a free Apple Developer account.  If you are enrolled in the Apple Developer Program (aka paid the $99), the expiration date will be for a year from the creation date.  Finally, you need to make sure to sign all FOUR \u201ctargets\u201d to the application; Loop, Loop Status Extension, WatchApp, and WatchApp Extension.  So far, we have only signed the Loop target.  Click on the blue \u201cLoop\u201d on the left and then the box with the vertical line to drop down the targets list.  Choose each of the remaining three targets and then select the signing team that you selected previously in the Loop target signing. Make sure you have signed all four targets.  If the \u201cloopkit\u201d still appears on the Bundle Identifier line, don\u2019t worry about it.  Xcode will update that to your chosen MAIN_APP name when it builds.  Sometimes Xcode is just slow to rename.  Just leave that Bundle Identifier line untouched.    At this point in the process, you should make any custom configurations to your Loop app before you finish with the installation of Loop on your iPhone.  If you want to make any of the customizations yourself, the step-by-step instructions are provided.  When you\u2019ve completed those customizations, please return here and follow the next steps to finish the installation of Loop.   All done with customizations? Let\u2019s finish the installation of the Loop app onto your iPhone.  Select your device and then press the \u201cplay\u201d button (or build button) to start XCode on its way.  [You may be prompted to add the iPhone to your Developer Account...go ahead and do so.]  You\u2019ll see the progression of the build in the status window.  If the build is successful, it will say \u201cfinished running Loop\u201d in the status bar.  If the build fails, it will show you red error alerts and you can read what the failure was.  Yellow error alerts do not cause the build to fail, those are just warnings.   If this is the first time you have installed an app on your iPhone using your Developer Account, you may get a warning like this.  Just follow the directions in the warning, and the issue resolves very quickly.  Click ok and you can safely disconnect your iPhone from the computer.  (If you don\u2019t get a warning and the Loop app installs but does not open, you may still need to go to Settings- General- Device Management and enable trust for your Developer Account.)   You can confirm Loop has installed on your phone simply by looking on the iphone.  Turn it on and check if the Loop app is running, or locating the Loop app icon.  If you don\u2019t see it, try pressing the build (play) button again.  There should be a message at the top of Xcode window indicating a successful build.  Once you get confirmation and can see Loop on your iPhone, you can simply unplug from computer.    CONGRATS!  YOU JUST INSTALLED LOOP!  ...",
