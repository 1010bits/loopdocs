            "text": "Insulin Pump\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nThere are a number of insulin pumps manufactured between 2006 \u2013 2012 by Medtronic which are compatible.  Compatibility has two requirements; (1) pump model and (2) firmware.  \n\n\nThe Loop-compatible pumps are as follows:\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \nInsulin Pump\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nMM 515/715\n\n      \nMM 522/722\n2\n\n      \nMM 523/723\n3\n\n      \nMM 554/754\n4\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n      \nCGM\n\n      \nDexcom G4\n1\n \n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nDexcom G5\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \nMM CGM\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n      \n\u2705\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n. Offline access to glucose requires a Receiver with Share and the \nShare2 app\n to be running on the same iPhone as the Loop app is installed. Internet-dependent access via Share servers is also supported.\n\n2\n. x22 model pumps were produced before firmware security patches were implemented, therefore these models are compatible because they will have firmware 2.4A or lower only.  You can double check, but thus far all x22 pumps we have seen have compatible firmware.\n\n3\n. Firmware 2.4A or lower is required for using Closed Loop and Bolus features.\n\n4\n. Worldwide Veo (2.6A or lower) or Canadian/Australian Veo (2.7A or lower) is required for using Closed Loop and Bolus features. US version of this pump is not available.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to triple check compatibility, you can check for presence/absence of \"PC connect\" in the pump.  If PC Connect is present, then the pump is NOT compatible.  You can find PC connect in the Medtronic's Main Menu, Utilities, Connect Devices.  PC Connect, if present, will be the first option showing in that menu, above the word \"Meters\".  If you do \nNOT\n see PC Connect there...good!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPump Model\n\u2301\n\n\nTo determine your pump model, look at the back side of your pump.  There should be a sticker on the underside of the pump.  On the right hand side of the sticker, it says REF MMT-XXXXXX\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, it says the pump model is:  MMT-722NAS\n\n\nMMT         Pump Manufacturer Model (MiniMed Medtronic)\n722         Pump Model Number\nNA          Pump Region (NA=North America, CA=Canada/Australia, WW=Worldwide)\nS           Pump Color (S=Smoke, L=Clear/Lucite, B=Blue, P=Pink/Purple)\n\n\n\n\nSome pumps may have an \u201cL\u201d or \u201cS\u201d or \"R\" before the pump region, e.g. a model number like MMT-LNAS.  This does not affect Loop compatibility.\n\n\nThe difference between the Medtronic 500 series and the 700 series pumps is the size of the insulin reservoirs.  The 500 series pumps use a 180 unit reservoir, and the 700 series pumps use a 300 unit reservoir (or smaller 180 unit reservoir, if you want).\n\n\nThe differences between Medtronic x22 pumps and x23/x54 pumps are primarily three features.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe x23/x54 pumps will allow for increments of 0.025 units, whereas the x22 pumps have larger increments of 0.05 units.  Loop will have the insulin delivery automatically rounded by the pump to the units available in the pump model, and any smaller adjustments (to make up for the rounding) will be made through Loop\u2019s use of temp basals.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, because of the way Loop fetches information from the pump, the x23/x54 series of pumps are slightly better at conserving battery life through the use of the MySentry.  x22 pumps do not use MySentry.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe x23/x54 series pumps are also faster at delivering large boluses (up to several times faster for boluses \n 10 units).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPump Firmware\n\u2301\n\n\nA pump\u2019s firmware is the internal software that runs your pump.  Older Medtronic firmware allows Loop to act as a \u201cremote control\u201d to set temp basals and report back pump data.  Newer firmware disabled that \u201cremote control\u201d access and therefore cannot be used with these DIY closed-loop systems.  There is currently no ability to downgrade a pump\u2019s firmware or replace it with older firmware.  Before you buy a used pump, make sure you are getting one with compatible firmware.\n\n\nTo find your pump\u2019s firmware you will need to power it up.  If the pump has not been powered on for some time (i.e., has been in storage without a battery for awhile), it will run through a start-up count and the firmware version will appear on the bottom right of the pump\u2019s screen.  Don\u2019t turn away, as the version number will only be displayed for a little while before the screen moves onto other information displays.  \n\n\nIf the pump has been active recently or has a reservoir installed, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress the \n button on your pump.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nScroll down with the \n button to the bottom of the status display.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the bottom line of the display.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther pumps\n\u2301\n\n\nWhile we all would love to have our {insert your favorite manufacturer} pump be compatible with a DIY closed-loop system like Loop, unfortunately it just isn't possible right now.  There are efforts being made to crack the software code on other pumps (like Animas and Omnipod), and when they are successful...believe me...we will tell you about it!\n\n\nFinding a Medtronic pump\n\u2301\n\n\nFinding a compatible Medtronic pump is probably the most difficult part for most new Loopers.  Our suggestion:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk to friends in the diabetic community.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk your endocrinologist.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk at a local JDRF chapter meeting if someone has an old backup pump they'd be willing to donate to you.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin diabetic supply groups in Facebook; both for-trade and for-sale groups.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Craigslist often and be willing to expand your search area to include larger cities.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch \nMedwow\n for used Medtronic pumps\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafe Purchasing\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you choose to purchase from a remote or unknown seller, here are some tips for safe purchasing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Paypal and purchase using the \"Goods and Services\" payment option.  This costs nothing for the buyer, but the seller will lose 2.95% of the sale to Paypal fees.  Paypal offers some protection for both buyer and seller in the event of fraud.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk for photos of the pump.  Check to make sure the serial number of the pump on the backside matches the serial number of the pump showing in the display menu.  Ask for a short video of the pump, or at least a photo of the pump turned on, so that you can see the pump's firmware and model number.  Cracks and some wear on these pumps is expected...these pumps are not usually free of any marks.  Many people are successfully looping on pumps that have cracks and rub marks...but you may want to ask if you are concerned about any you see.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk for shipping that includes a tracking number.  USPS Priority Mail's smallest box is a great option.  It's only $7.15 and includes tracking.  Ask the seller to add a small bit of packing protection such as bubble wrap around the pump to keep it safe during shipping.  Make sure you get a tracking number within a reasonable period of time after you have paid.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed flags that may indicate a scam:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsking for payment through \"friends and family\" on Paypal, especially if you don't know the person or have any solid references for them.  Paying in that way offers you no buyer protection.  It's just like giving the seller cash, so you had better trust the seller.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffering an \"almost new\" pump is a big red flag.  These pumps should be at least 5 years old by now.  Do you really think a 5 year old pump should be unused and sitting in shrink wrap at this point?  Seems highly suspicious.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot able to provide new pictures of the pump when requested.  Sure they posted some pictures with the ad, but what if they just downloaded them from other people's ads?  The seller should be able to furnish a couple \"new\" photos are your request.  A good one to ask for is the battery and reservoir tops so you can see the condition of those.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPump Supplies\n\u2301\n\n\nMedtronic will not typically want to sell pump supplies directly to customers who do not have an in-warranty Medtronic pump registered in their system.  Ask your insurance about purchasing pump supplies through a durable medical equipment (DME) provider.  If you are brand new to Medtronic infusion sites, you may want to ask for help from friends to try a variety of infusion sets before purchasing a full 90-day supply of any in particular.",

Ask for a short video of the pump, or at least a photo of the pump turned on, so that you can see the pump's firmware and model number.  Cracks and some wear on these pumps is expected...these pumps are not usually free of any marks.  Many people are successfully looping on pumps that have cracks and rub marks...but you may want to ask if you are concerned about any you see.      Ask for shipping that includes a tracking number.  USPS Priority Mail's smallest box is a great option.  It's only $7.15 and includes tracking.  Ask the seller to add a small bit of packing protection such as bubble wrap around the pump to keep it safe during shipping.  Make sure you get a tracking number within a reasonable period of time after you have paid.      Red flags that may indicate a scam:    Asking for payment through \"friends and family\" on Paypal, especially if you don't know the person or have any solid references for them.  Paying in that way offers you no buyer protection.  It's just like giving the seller cash, so you had better trust the seller.      Offering an \"almost new\" pump is a big red flag.  These pumps should be at least 5 years old by now.  Do you really think a 5 year old pump should be unused and sitting in shrink wrap at this point?  Seems highly suspicious.      Not able to provide new pictures of the pump when requested.  Sure they posted some pictures with the ad, but what if they just downloaded them from other people's ads?  The seller should be able to furnish a couple \"new\" photos are your request.  A good one to ask for is the battery and reservoir tops so you can see the condition of those.",

Let\u2019s put that Loop on your iPhone.\n\n\nSetup your Apple Computer\n\u2301\n\n\nVerify OS X\n\u2301\n\n\nYou need to be running OS X Sierra, so verify by clicking the apple logo in your computer display's upper left corner and selecting \"About this Mac\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your OS X is not Sierra, click on the \nSoftware Update\n button and update to Sierra.  If your computer is older than late 2009, you may not be able to update to Sierra.  You can check Sierra compatibility \nhere\n. \n\n\nInstall Xcode\n\u2301\n\n\nGo to the \nApple App Store\n? It\u2019s an application on your Apple Computer.  Open it and search for Xcode.  Download and install it for free.  Easy peasy.  Except it takes about 20-40 minutes to download depending on your internet speed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall Carthage\n\u2301\n\n\nThe installation of Carthage has a few different ways it can be done, but the easiest is to download the Carthage package here:\n\n\nCarthage.pkg download\n       \n\n\nFind the downloaded \ncarthage.pkg\n in your Downloads folder (option-command-L while in Finder will bring up your Downloads folder).  Double-click the file and follow the directions to install (basically give your computer\u2019s password and it does the rest).  Done.  Nothing more needs to happen with Carthage (it runs in the background). Note: if you get a message that says \"Carthage.pkg can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.\", then click OK and go to your computer's System Preferences app.  Choose \nSecurity and Privacy\n and then click on the \"Open Anyway\" button for the Carthage.pkg.\n\n\n\n\n\nIF you have problems with that method, you can use the \u201cHomebrew method\u201d.  And here\u2019s how it is done:\nOpen the Terminal application on your Apple computer (it is located in the Utilities application folder)\n\n\nCopy and paste the line below into the prompt in Terminal.  Press return after you paste it in.\n\n\n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\n\nThere will be a prompt asking if you want to continue (press return to continue, then it may prompt for your password.  enter your computer user password.).  Wait while the script does its thing...you\u2019ll see info scroll by and then it will pause for awhile.  Eventually, it will be done and you\u2019ll see something that says \u201cInstallation successful\u201d and you\u2019ll have a ready terminal prompt again.\n\n\nType \nbrew update\n and press return.\n\n\nType \nbrew install carthage\n and press return.  You can confirm carthage has been installed by running \ncarthage version\n and it should return 0.24.0.  \n\n\nYou can close the Terminal application now.  You\u2019re done with it.  Phew.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Loop Source Code\n\u2301\n\n\nYou\u2019ll need to obtain the Loop\u2019s source code in order to build the app on your computer.  If you click on the link below, a copy of the Loop source code\u2019s master branch will be downloaded to your Downloads folder.\n\n\n\nLoop: Master branch source code\n\n\n\nAdvanced method: Alternatively, if you are already familiar with git and Terminal app use, you could save a local copy of Loop source code to your computer using \ngit clone https://github.com/LoopKit/Loop.git\n.  This method would allow for saving local changes and updating, but does require some familiarity with git commands.  For new users, or those unfamiliar with git, we recommend using the direct download of master branch, above.\n\n\n\n\nDo not build your Loop app by downloading your source code to iCloud.  There are problems with building Loop, related to carthage, when using iCloud.  Make sure you download Loop code directly to your local computer for building Loop app.\n\n\nInstall Loop using Xcode\n\u2301\n\n\nHere\u2019s where the fun really begins.  You\u2019re about to build your Loop app.\n\n\nGo to your Downloads folder, open the Loop folder, and double click on Loop.xcodeproj.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA warning may appear asking if you really want to open it, click Open.  Xcode will open the project, and take a few moments to organize the files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce Xcode has finished indexing, the Loop project will appear in the far left column.  Click on the blue Loop icon, and then click on the file called Loop.xcconfig.  The middle portion of Xcode window will populate and this is where you will find the MAIN_APP_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER. The default is com.loopkit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need to change the MAIN_APP_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER  to your own unique identifier.  Keep it in the reverse-domain syntax, meaning start with \u201ccom.\u201d (no quotes though).  \nAfter you enter your new MAIN_APP_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER, save the project using Command-S\n, and then click on the blue \u201cLoop\u201d file in the far left column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next steps are to \u201csign\u201d the application so that Apple will allow its use on the iPhone.  You will need to select a \u201cteam\u201d.  If you already have a team from previous Xcode projects, you may see teams listed.  Use the dropdown menu to select the appropriate team.  Make sure you keep the \u201cautomatically manage signing\u201d box checked.  \n\n\nIf, however, this is your first time signing an app in Xcode, your screen may instead look like the screen below.  In which case, you will need to add a developer account (either free or paid) by clicking on \u201cAdd Account\u201d.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAdd Account\u201d will open the Xcode preferences window, as shown below.  You will need to sign in with your Apple ID (or create one, if you don\u2019t already have one).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you get signed in, your Apple ID will appear under the Accounts section as shown below.  Close that window by pressing the little red circle in the upper left corner, and you will return to the main Xcode screen again.\n\n\nNote: You may need to close Xcode and restart to see your Apple account for signing to appear in the Signing section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSidenote about signing teams and developer account\n\n\nIf you sign using a team with \u201c(Personal Team)\u201d, these apps will expire after 7 days as they have been created with the free developer account profiles.\n\n\nIf you sign using a team WITHOUT \u201c(Personal Team)\u201d, as shown below, the app will be valid for the full duration of your apple developer account enrollment (one-year subscriptions).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany people think \u201cHey I\u2019ll try to build this Loop for free and if I like it, then I\u2019ll buy the $99 Apple Developer license.\u201d  If that\u2019s you right now, please come back here when you are ready to reinstall as a paid developer account.  You will need to:\n\n\n\n\nSelect the correct team because now there will be two to choose from.  Use the one without the \u201c(Personal Team)\u201d to build apps that last a full 12 months.\n\n\nWhen you rebuild your app, choose a new MAIN_APP_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER different than your previous one.  For example, if you used \u201ccom.yourname\u201d on the free app then choose \u201ccom.yourname2\u201d for the new paid app.  \n\n\nYou will have to re-enter your Loop settings on your new app once it is installed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you return to the main screen, select your team name and you may see two status warnings.  The first warning may appear if you do not have an iPhone plugged into the Mac.  The \u201cfailed to create a provisioning profile\u201d has details that should alert you to plug in your device (iPhone).  Once you connect your iPhone via cable to the Mac, select your iPhone from the hidden drop down list (see red arrow below).  Your device\u2019s personal name should be at the top of the list.  Select your personal device. You may need to \u201cregister the device\u201d if this is your first time using Xcode with that iphone, follow the prompt if that\u2019s the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you select your device, Xcode should resolve the warnings and generate a Provisioning Profile.  If you click on the information icon (little \u201ci\u201d in the circle), for the Provisioning Profile, you can verify the signing date and mark your calendar for rebuilding in 7 days if you are using a free Apple Developer account.  If you are enrolled in the Apple Developer Program (aka paid the $99), the expiration date will be for a year from the creation date.\n\n\nFinally, you need to make sure to sign all FOUR \u201ctargets\u201d to the application; Loop, Loop Status Extension, WatchApp, and WatchApp Extension.  So far, we have only signed the Loop target.  Click on the blue \u201cLoop\u201d on the left and then the box with the vertical line to drop down the targets list.  Choose each of the remaining three targets and then select the signing team that you selected previously in the Loop target signing. Make sure you have signed all four targets.  If the \u201cloopkit\u201d still appears on the Bundle Identifier line, don\u2019t worry about it.  Xcode will update that to your chosen MAIN_APP name when it builds.  Sometimes Xcode is just slow to rename.  Just leave that Bundle Identifier line untouched.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomizations\n\n\nNew Loop users\n: Customizations are not a required part of any Loop build.  As you gain experience in how you use your Loop app, you may want to customize some of the features.  You can always update your Loop app to add customizations at a later time.\n\nIf you want any custom configurations to your Loop app, now is the time to make them before you finish with the installation of Loop on your iPhone.  Follow the step-by-step instructions (found by clicking on the \"Code Customizations\" link to the left).  When you\u2019ve completed those customizations, please return here and follow the next steps to finish the installation of Loop.\n\n\n\n\nAll done with customizations? Let\u2019s finish the installation of the Loop app onto your iPhone.  Select your iPhone's name and then press the \u201cplay\u201d button (or build button) to start Xcode on its way.  You may be prompted to add the iPhone to your Developer Account...go ahead and do so.  You\u2019ll see the progression of the build in the status window.  If the build is successful, it will say \"running Loop\" or \"finished running Loop\" in the status bar.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this is the first time you have installed an app on your iPhone using your Developer Account, you may get a warning like this.  Just follow the directions in the warning, and the issue resolves very quickly.  Click ok and you can safely disconnect your iPhone from the computer.  (If you don\u2019t get a warning and the Loop app installs but does not open, you may still need to go to Settings-\nGeneral-\nDevice Management and enable trust for your Developer Account.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can confirm Loop has installed on your phone simply by looking on the iPhone.  Turn it on and check if the Loop app is running, or locating the Loop app icon.  If you don\u2019t see it, try pressing the build (play) button again.  There should be a message at the top of Xcode window indicating a successful build.  Once you get confirmation and can see Loop on your iPhone, you can simply unplug from computer and begin the configuration steps within the Loop app.  \n\n\nCONGRATS!  YOU JUST INSTALLED LOOP!\n\n\nBuild Errors\n\u2301\n\n\nYellow error alerts\n do not cause the build to fail, those are just warnings.  The current version of Loop (v1.3.3) has a yellow alert that will appear when you build, as shown below, regarding GetRecentGlucoseChange.  You can ignore that alert.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed error alerts\n will prevent Loop from building on your phone, and you can read what the failure was.  The most common red error alerts are: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Apple Developer Program License Agreement has been updated,  In order to access certain membership resources, you must accept the latest license agreement.\"  You'll need to log onto your Developer account at developer.apple.com and accept the latest license agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Could not locate device support files.  This iPhone is running iOS 10.3.2 which may not be supported by this version of Xcode.\"  You will need to go to your Mac's App Store and download \n install the Xcode app update.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Swift Compilier Error.  Module compiled with Swift 3.0.2 cannot be imported in Swift 3.1\"  Make sure your Xcode app is updated (see item above) and make sure you have a fresh download of the Loop source code.  Older Loop versions will not compile with the new Xcode app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The app ID \"com.loopkit.Loop\" cannot be registered to your development team. Change your bundle identifier to a unique string to try again.  Provisioning profile \"iOS Team Provisioning Profile: *\" doesn't support the App Groups and HealthKit capabilities\"  These error commonly appears when you have forgotten to press command-s to save your project after changing the main app bundle identifier.  When this error occurs, it is best to simply delete your Loop folder from the downloads folder and start again.  Make a fresh download of Loop source code, and this time remember to press command-s after you change the main app bundle identifier and before you sign and build the app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Customizations\n\u2301\n\n\nBased on Loop users\u2019 experience, there are some customizations that you may want to incorporate ahead of building your Loop app.  These customizations must be done prior to building the Loop app onto your iPhone, they cannot be done from within the app itself.\n\n\n[Note: To help you find the Line numbers in Xcode, it may be helpful to turn them on now.  Go to Xcode Preferences, under Text Editing, click the box to Show Line Numbers.  Every effort will be made to update the line numbers as the code is updated periodically, but there may be times where the screenshots and line numbers are slightly different than the current version of Loop code.]\n\n\nDefault Carb Absorption Times\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nLoop\u2019s default carb absorption times are based on the high, medium, and low glycemic index absorption curves presented in \nThink Like A Pancreas\n by Gary Scheiner.  Currently the lollipop icon is set for 120 minutes, taco icon for 180 minutes, and pizza icon for 240 minutes.  These default values may not work for everyone, you will need to find what works for you.\n\n\nYou can modify these defaults to suit your needs, however it would be best to test your own carb absorption patterns before necessarily adjusting the defaults.  You can always modify these after you\u2019ve had some Loop experience and simply reinstall the Loop.  (after all, you\u2019re a pro at that now)  Section 6 provides some examples of analyzing meal and Loop behaviors to determine if your carb absorption times are accurate.\n\n\nIf you would like to modify those defaults, you can do so in the LoopDataManager.swift Line 57.  Note, the times are in hours, not minutes, in the code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoop Logo\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you want an app logo other than the default green circle for your Loop app, you can easily customize this.  To make it easy to generate the correct sizes of icons, you can use a site like \nappicon.build\n and just drag and drop your source image. The site will email you a zip file.  Double click the zip file, choose the \u201cios\u201d folder, and copy the contents of the Appicon.appiconset as shown highlighted below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow navigate to the corresponding Loop folder as shown below.  Replace the contents of the Appicon.appiconset with your copied images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can confirm the successful change by looking in Xcode.  You should see your custom logo in the Appicon set now.  You will also likely see a yellow alert that there are \u201c5 unassigned children\u201d.  This alert will not prevent your app from building, it\u2019s simply because the zipfile contained more sizes of images than Loop app uses.  You can just leave the unassigned images as is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoop Graph hours\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you want the Loop\u2019s graphs to display different time length than the default, you will go to the StatusTableViewController.swift line 181. This code keeps track of how many hours to display in total and how far into the future to display on your graphs. For total hours it does a calculation based upon your screen size and how granular to display between each segment. For how far forward to display, it currently uses your Insulin Action Duration setting to determine this (and if that number is missing for some reason it defaults to 4 hours).\n\n\nPlease note, using this will make it more difficult to see changes in other charts on your screen (like length of temp basal).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are a couple of ways you could modify line 181 based on your specific wants:\n\n\nWant double the amount of total hours shown?\n\nlet historyHours = (totalHours * 2) - (dataManager.insulinActionDuration ?? TimeInterval(hours: 4)).hours\n\n\nWant 1/2 of my Insulin Action Duration to show in the future?\n\nlet historyHours = totalHours - ((dataManager.insulinActionDuration / 2) ?? TimeInterval(hours: 4)).hours\n\n\nWant 2.5 x the total time and only 2 hours forward within that?\n\nlet historyHours = (totalHours * 2.5) - (TimeInterval(hours: 2)).hours\n\n\nWorkout Range Duration\n\u2301\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like more than just the standard 1 or 2 hour duration for the Workout Range, you can add or modify the code to add another time interval or edit the existing ones.\n\n\nGo to the Loop\nExtensions\nUIAlertController.swift and modify Line 30.  The default has 1 and 2 hours as shown where the arrow is pointing in the screenshot.  You can edit those to whatever duration you want (in units of hours) and add a duration if you prefer.  If you\u2019d like 1, 2, and 3 hours options...simply edit the numbers in the brackets to read [1, 2, 3]. It is possible to enter less than 1 hour intervals such as 15min, 30 min, 45 min by editing the brackets to read [0.25, 0.5, 0.75].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple Watch Customizations\n\u2301\n\n\nRecommended Bolus Autofill\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Apple Watch's default is to autofill to 75% of the recommended bolus.  If you wish, you can customize so that the watch autofills a different percentage. To do this, the multiplier can be changed from 0.75 to a value of your choice. A value of 1 will autofill 100% of the recommended bolus. A value of 0 will autofill 0% of the recommended bolus.   Go to the Loop Watchapp Extension Folder, within that go to the controllers folder, within that go to BolusInterfaceController.swift. Edit the section of line 97 as indicated on the picture below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjust sensitivity of digital crown for carb and bolus entry\n\u2301\n\n\nThe rate of change of the carb and bolus entry pickers when using the digital crown can be altered. Navigate to the WatchApp Extension folder and within that the Controllers folder. Edit line 130 of AddCarbsInterfaceController.swift and line 161 of BolusInterfaceController.swift. The 1/24 value is the ratio of rotations of the crown to the amount of change in the value. Changing it to 1/12 would mean that twice as many turns would be needed for the same amount of carb or bolus entry.",

If you already have a team from previous Xcode projects, you may see teams listed.  Use the dropdown menu to select the appropriate team.  Make sure you keep the \u201cautomatically manage signing\u201d box checked.    If, however, this is your first time signing an app in Xcode, your screen may instead look like the screen below.  In which case, you will need to add a developer account (either free or paid) by clicking on \u201cAdd Account\u201d.       \u201cAdd Account\u201d will open the Xcode preferences window, as shown below.  You will need to sign in with your Apple ID (or create one, if you don\u2019t already have one).     Once you get signed in, your Apple ID will appear under the Accounts section as shown below.  Close that window by pressing the little red circle in the upper left corner, and you will return to the main Xcode screen again.  Note: You may need to close Xcode and restart to see your Apple account for signing to appear in the Signing section.      Sidenote about signing teams and developer account  If you sign using a team with \u201c(Personal Team)\u201d, these apps will expire after 7 days as they have been created with the free developer account profiles.  If you sign using a team WITHOUT \u201c(Personal Team)\u201d, as shown below, the app will be valid for the full duration of your apple developer account enrollment (one-year subscriptions).     Many people think \u201cHey I\u2019ll try to build this Loop for free and if I like it, then I\u2019ll buy the $99 Apple Developer license.\u201d  If that\u2019s you right now, please come back here when you are ready to reinstall as a paid developer account.  You will need to:   Select the correct team because now there will be two to choose from.  Use the one without the \u201c(Personal Team)\u201d to build apps that last a full 12 months.  When you rebuild your app, choose a new MAIN_APP_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER different than your previous one.  For example, if you used \u201ccom.yourname\u201d on the free app then choose \u201ccom.yourname2\u201d for the new paid app.    You will have to re-enter your Loop settings on your new app once it is installed.    When you return to the main screen, select your team name and you may see two status warnings.  The first warning may appear if you do not have an iPhone plugged into the Mac.  The \u201cfailed to create a provisioning profile\u201d has details that should alert you to plug in your device (iPhone).  Once you connect your iPhone via cable to the Mac, select your iPhone from the hidden drop down list (see red arrow below).  Your device\u2019s personal name should be at the top of the list.  Select your personal device. You may need to \u201cregister the device\u201d if this is your first time using Xcode with that iphone, follow the prompt if that\u2019s the case.     Once you select your device, Xcode should resolve the warnings and generate a Provisioning Profile.  If you click on the information icon (little \u201ci\u201d in the circle), for the Provisioning Profile, you can verify the signing date and mark your calendar for rebuilding in 7 days if you are using a free Apple Developer account.  If you are enrolled in the Apple Developer Program (aka paid the $99), the expiration date will be for a year from the creation date.  Finally, you need to make sure to sign all FOUR \u201ctargets\u201d to the application; Loop, Loop Status Extension, WatchApp, and WatchApp Extension.  So far, we have only signed the Loop target.  Click on the blue \u201cLoop\u201d on the left and then the box with the vertical line to drop down the targets list.  Choose each of the remaining three targets and then select the signing team that you selected previously in the Loop target signing. Make sure you have signed all four targets.  If the \u201cloopkit\u201d still appears on the Bundle Identifier line, don\u2019t worry about it.  Xcode will update that to your chosen MAIN_APP name when it builds.  Sometimes Xcode is just slow to rename.  Just leave that Bundle Identifier line untouched.      Customizations  New Loop users : Customizations are not a required part of any Loop build.  As you gain experience in how you use your Loop app, you may want to customize some of the features.  You can always update your Loop app to add customizations at a later time. \nIf you want any custom configurations to your Loop app, now is the time to make them before you finish with the installation of Loop on your iPhone.  Follow the step-by-step instructions (found by clicking on the \"Code Customizations\" link to the left).  When you\u2019ve completed those customizations, please return here and follow the next steps to finish the installation of Loop.   All done with customizations? Let\u2019s finish the installation of the Loop app onto your iPhone.  Select your iPhone's name and then press the \u201cplay\u201d button (or build button) to start Xcode on its way.  You may be prompted to add the iPhone to your Developer Account...go ahead and do so.  You\u2019ll see the progression of the build in the status window.  If the build is successful, it will say \"running Loop\" or \"finished running Loop\" in the status bar.       If this is the first time you have installed an app on your iPhone using your Developer Account, you may get a warning like this.  Just follow the directions in the warning, and the issue resolves very quickly.  Click ok and you can safely disconnect your iPhone from the computer.  (If you don\u2019t get a warning and the Loop app installs but does not open, you may still need to go to Settings- General- Device Management and enable trust for your Developer Account.)     You can confirm Loop has installed on your phone simply by looking on the iPhone.  Turn it on and check if the Loop app is running, or locating the Loop app icon.  If you don\u2019t see it, try pressing the build (play) button again.  There should be a message at the top of Xcode window indicating a successful build.  Once you get confirmation and can see Loop on your iPhone, you can simply unplug from computer and begin the configuration steps within the Loop app.    CONGRATS!  YOU JUST INSTALLED LOOP!",

            "text": "Configuring your Loop\n\u2301\n\n\nNow that you have the Loop app installed on your iPhone, we need to input the settings so that the Loop can work for you.  In this section, we cover the details and provide information about the Loop displays.  Finally, we will cover some extras like Apple Watch and useful external integrations.\n\n\nHealth App\n\u2301\n\n\nLoop app uses the iPhone's Health app to store BG and carbohydrate data.  The Health app will be one of the first prompts that you see as your Loop app is built.  The first prompt will ask if you want to allow the Loop app access to read/write Blood Glucose data into the Health app.  You will want to click on the line that says \nTurn All Categories On\n and then click on the \nAllow\n button.\n\n\nLater in the configuration of your Loop app, when you first setup carb ratios, you will again be prompted whether to allow Loop app access to read/write to the Health app.  This time the access will be for carbohydrate data.  This time you should turn on only the first toggle to allow Loop to write data (not to read data) and click the \nAllow\n button.  See discussion regarding \nThird Party Apps\n for the reasoning behind this selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSettings\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormally, we would start by explaining the displays on an application, but your Loop won\u2019t have much showing initially until we get some basic settings input.  So, let\u2019s start by clicking on the Loop Settings button in the tool bar.  It looks like a little sprocket.\n\n\nLoop Version\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first graphic at the top of the Loop settings display shows the version of the software, e.g.,  Loop v1.3 in this example.  This can be helpful when working with other users of the software to know what version you are running.\n\n\nClosed Loop\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Closed Loop switch controls the Loop operation mode for the application. This operation mode determines whether Loop automatically enacts recommendations (i.e., sets temp basals) to the insulin pump.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Closed Loop switch is in the (Off\n   ) position, Loop WILL NOT enact recommended temp basals automatically.  Instead, it will display Recommended Temp Basals on the main status display, just above the Glucose graph.  This is called \u201cOpen Loop\u201d, and is a good way to understand how Loop will function, and what type of recommendations it would make.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Closed Loop switch is in the (\n   On) position, Loop WILL automatically enact recommended temp basals on the configured insulin pump. This is known as a \u201cClosed Loop\u201d.  Typically, Loop will show the recommended temp basal just above the Glucose graph prior to automatically enacting it.  It may take a minute or so for the Loop to enact the recommended basal.  Once the temp basal has been enacted successfully on the pump, the recommended temp basal will disappear from the screen and the new temp basal will be represented in the insulin delivery graphics.\n\n\nPreferred Data Source\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Preferred Data Source is set to \u201cEvent History\u201d, then the pump will periodically be polled for treatment events.  This will cause your battery to be used at a faster rate, but there are benefits.  \n\n\n\n\nEvent History must be selected for Nightscout to display temp basals, carbs, and boluses from Loop.\n  Event History must also be selected in order for prime events to be detected and NOT contribute to iob during site changes.\n\n\n\n\nIssue Report\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you run into problems or errors with your Loop, the Issue Report can be used to help identify where the problem is occurring.  The Issue Report is automatically generated and you can share it via email.  Frequently, if you go to Gitter or Facebook for help with a technical problem, an Issue Report will provide insight to what the potential problem is.\n\n\nDevices\n\u2301\n\n\nIf your RileyLink is turned on and nearby, you will see a RileyLink in this area of the settings (like the first screenshot on this page).  We are going to take care of the RileyLink settings later in this page...for now we are going to skip the RileyLink line.\n\n\nPump ID\n\u2301\n\n\nFairly self-explanatory.  You need to enter your pump\u2019s six-digit ID here.  To find your pump ID, press ESC button on the pump, scroll down.  You will find a the six-digit ID as the \u201cS/N#\u201d.  You will also find the same ID on the back of the pump as six numbers beneath the pump\u2019s model number.  There are also explanations so you can identify the pump\u2019s region.  This makes a difference for how the RileyLink will tune its frequency for pump communications.\n\n\nPump Battery Type\n\u2301\n\n\nAgain fairly self-explanatory.  Click which battery type you are using so that the battery percentages are more accurately displayed in your HUD.  The battery displays are designed to give you approximately 8-10 hours notice before looping would fail.  However, every battery manufacturer has its own decay curve for its specific batteries.  Typically, low battery levels will cause looping failures prior to the actual pump failing to delivery insulin. \n\n\nCGM Selection\n\u2301\n\n\nSelect one of the options from the menu:\n\n\n\n\nFetch Enlite Data\n\n\nG4 Share Receiver\n\n\nG5 Transmitter\n\n\n\n\nIf you select the G5 Transmitter, you will be prompted to enter the transmitter ID number.  Don't forget to update your transmitter ID when you change transmitters, otherwise your loop will not work.\n\n\nTarget Range\n\u2301\n\n\nThis is where you set your target blood glucose range.  This is the low and high BG values that Loop will attempt to keep you between.  Click the + in the upper right corner to add target BG range(s).  You can have multiple targets based on time of day, but for safety purposes the first setting of the day should begin at midnight to be consistent with your Medtronic pump.  \n\n\nTargets will be entered in mg/dl or mmoL automatically based upon how your BG values appear your BG chart. By default they are set to mg/dl, however once BG values arrive in mmoL these settings can be entered in mmoL. If you are planning to use mmoL, be sure to wait to set your target range up until after you have started to receive BG values. If you do these in the wrong order, then your chart may have incorrect Y axis. If you come across this issue, you can also remove all of your target ranges and enter them again. Once you are receiving BG values in mmoL, you can add your Target Range in mmoL.\n\n\nYou can also set the \u201coverride\u201d targets here to temporarily use alternate BG targets.  These override targets will only be enacted when you specifically activate \u201cWorkout Mode\u201d. \n\n\nTarget range can be a single number, such as 100-100 mg/dL, but is not necessarily advised or \u201cbetter\u201d.\n\n\nMinimum BG Guard\n\u2301\n\n\nMinimum BG Guard is a required data entry for successful configuration of Loop. \nYour Loop will not turn green without setting this value.\n  \n\n\nMinimum BG Guard allows a user to bolus when their BG is below their target range but not below the value of the Minimum BG Guard.  To help users understand how this setting is affecting their usage of Loop, users will see a new notification icon and details of why there is no recommended bolus if the predicted BG is below the Minimum BG Guard.  \n\n\nInsulin Action Duration (DIA)\n\u2301\n\n\nEnter your insulin action duration here in hours.  This is also called Duration of Insulin Action (DIA).  Typically, close-loopers use between 3-5 hours with good success.  However, your diabetes may vary.  This number is a real number so decimals work here for fractions of hours. Like (3.5) = 3hrs 30 mins\n\n\nBasal Rates\n\u2301\n\n\nEnter your basal rates here.  These should match the values entered in your pump. Entering them here will not override your pump\u2019s values, so make sure they match. This is fairly standard stuff that most T1Ds are already familiar with.  However, if you are new to Medtronic pumps...keep in mind that your insulin needs may change slightly when changing pump systems.  If in doubt, try some basal testing to see if your old basal rates may need adjustments with the switch to Medtronic pumps and infusion sets.\n\n\nOnly one basal pattern may be set in each Loop app.  If you are accustomed to switching between two or more basal patterns frequently, you have two options:\n\n\n\n\nmanually editing the basal profiles in this area each time you change basals, or\n\n\ninstalling a duplicate Loop app for each basal pattern and switching when needed.\n\n\n\n\nIf you choose to have duplicate Loop apps, you will need to use different MAIN_APP_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIERs for each app.  Additionally, you must remember to close  the unused Loop app (double-click iPhone home button and up-swipe Loop app).  Only one Loop app can run successfully at a time.  When you switch to the new Loop app, it may take 5-15 minutes for the Loop to turn green.  The good news is that all your carb entries, insulin doses and such will automatically populate in the new Loop within a relatively short amount of time and the transition is therefore seamless for Loop functionality.  \n\n\nCarb Ratios\n\u2301\n\n\nClick the + in the upper right to add carb ratios for various times of day. Loop works best if you have tested and optimized your carb ratio settings for accuracy.\n\n\nThe first time you setup carb ratios, you will be prompted to allow Loop app access to write/read data in your iPhone's Health App, choose only the selection for \nwrite\n data so that Loop does not inadvertently read third party app's carbohydrate inputs.  See \nCarb Entries with Third Party apps\n for more information about this setting.\n\n\nInsulin Sensitivities\n\u2301\n\n\nClick the + in the upper right to add insulin sensitivities for various times of day. Loop works best if you have tested and optimized your ISF settings for accuracy.  Insulin sensitivities can change for many reasons including waiting too long to change your infusion set.  Loop will not auto-detect changes in ISF.\n\n\nMaximum Basal Rate\n\u2301\n\n\nMaximum basal rate is the maximum temporary basal rate that the Loop is allowed to enact to correct to your target BG range.  See the Use section discussion for Close Loop for some suggestions regarding appropriate Maximum Basal Rate.\n\n\n\n\nA frequent error for new Loop users is when they set their maximum basal rate here to a value HIGHER than the corresponding setting on the pump.  This will result in an error message that the temp basal failed to enact.  For example, Loop cannot successfully tell the pump to deliver 4 units per hour if the pump\u2019s maximum is set to only 3.8 units per hour.  If you are seeing failures of the Loop to set a high temp basal, check to see if your pump\u2019s maximum basal is at greater than or equal to the Loop\u2019s maximum basal.\n\n\n\n\nMaximum Bolus\n\u2301\n\n\nEnter your desired single bolus maximum here.\n\n\nServices\n\u2301\n\n\nThe services listed in this section are \nOPTIONAL\n.  You can choose to leave them empty and your Loop will still work.  \n\n\nNightscout\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you have an existing Nightscout site, add the Site URL and API Secret to have your Loop data transmitted to your Nightscout site. If you can\u2019t remember your API Secret, it can be found under Settings, Reveal Config Vars for Heroku sites (or Application Settings, Connection Strings for Azure sites). \n\n\nmLab\n\u2301\n\n\nmLab is a cloud-hosted Mongo Database service.  mLab is used by Loop as a remote repository of Loop status data.  This data is very helpful if you having issues with Loop and need to see remotely what Loop is doing and get diagnostics. If you already have a Nightscout site, you can use your existing mLab database.  As the screen shot below shows, this integration will log the errors from your Loop app and help you troubleshoot if you notice a pattern of problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get your database name:\n\n\nIf you have Nightscout, access your mLab.

If you sign up for an account, you'll need to go under Source Setup and then Customer Tokens.  Copy and paste your customer token into your Loop App settings for Loggly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmplitude\n\u2301\n\n\nAmplitude\n is a remote event monitoring service and can be used to quickly identify errors and events with Loop.  Amplitude stores the events and allows you to view those events as points in time.  To retrieve the details of the events you will need to look at corresponding mLab data entries to get a complete picture of the issues.  If you sign up for a free account with Amplitude, you will be given an API Key that you can enter here to have Loop integration setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRileyLink\n\u2301\n\n\nRileyLink is turned on with a little switch on the side of the circuit board (little blue lights will flash briefly and then turn off).  The \u201con\u201d position is with the switch towards the battery plug.  Now that you have it turned on, go back to your Loop settings and under \u201cDevices\u201d, there will be a connection to turn on.  Turn it on (slide to green) and then click on the arrow to the right of the green slider to open the RileyLink settings area.  Your RileyLink will now have a solid green light showing.  The solid green light indicates a working bluetooth connection with your iPhone. \n\n\nDevice\n\u2301\n\n\nThe settings under the Device section are mostly for your information only.  However, you can rename your RileyLink to something more unique.  This is a good idea if you own more than one or are ever in the presence of more than one RileyLink...you will be able to pick out your connection easier amongst a crowd of \u201cRileyLinks\u201d.\n\n\nThe \nSignal Strength\n showing under this area of the menu is the signal strength of the BT with the iPhone.  It is \nnot\n the signal strength of the radio communications with the pump.\n\n\nPump\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Pump ID should be automatically filled in from the setting you have already entered previously.  The pump model will say unknown until we proceed with \u201cTune Radio Frequency.\u201d \n\n\nCommands\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\nTune Radio Frequency: Choose \u201cTune Radio Frequency\u201d.  It may take about a minute, but soon you will see a list of frequencies and you can exit back to the main RileyLink settings.  The Command line will now show the frequency (916.xx MHz) in the first command line and the timestamp of the tune.  Now your pump and RileyLink are tuned to talk to each other.  When people suggest \"did you retune your RileyLink?\" they are referring to this line's command.\n\n\n\n\n(Note: for the rest of these items you may first need to set a Remote ID as discussed in the Pump Setup below.)\n\n\n\n\nChange Time:  Choose \u201cchange time\u201d so that pump and Loop times will match exactly.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should never use the pump itself to set the pump\u2019s time.\n  Always use the RileyLink to set pump time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMySentry Pair:  MySentry Pairing is for x23 and x54 pumps.  Follow the directions as shown in the RileyLink command screen for MySentry.  You do not have to worry about this command if you are using an x15 or x22 model pump, as they do not have MySentry.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not perform a MySentry pairing and have an x23 or x54 pump, your loop will only turn green every 15 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFetch Recent History, Fetch Recent Glucose, Write Glucose History Timestamp, Get Pump Model, and Send Button Press, Read Pump Status, and Read Basal Schedule are all ways of asking the pump for information you might be interested in.  They are not part of setting up the Loop.  Send Button Press can be useful to see if the communication between the RileyLink and pump is working.  If successful, the screen on the pump will light up and Loop will confirm the button press with a \u201csuccess\u201d message.  Read Pump Status is also nice quick pump read for reservoir volume, pump battery voltage, and pump status (bolusing or suspending).\n\n\n\n\nPump Setup\n\u2301\n\n\nNow that you are done with your Loop app settings, you need to finish setting up your pump for Loop use.  Generally, the setup of the pump is similar to setting up any pump for non-looping use.  One notable exception: you will need to change those batteries more often with Looping.  Loop will drain pump batteries much faster than regular pump regimes, and Loop failures will increase in frequency as the pump battery gets low.}\n\n\nWhile not every setting NEEDS to match between Loop and pump, it is safer to have them match in case your Loop fails and you revert back to normal pump use.  You should program the pump settings to match for:\n\n\n\n\nBasal program(s)\n\n\nCarb ratio\n\n\nISF\n\n\nMax bolus\n\n\nInsulin action duration\n\n\nBG targets\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree settings in particular need to be done, OR ELSE YOUR LOOP WON'T WORK:\n\n    * Set \u201cmax temp basal\u201d in pump to at least equal to (or slightly greater) than the Loop\u2019s max basal\n\n    * Set \u201ctemp basal type\u201d to \u201cinsulin rate (u/h)\u201d\n\n    * Set Remote ID to \"on\" and enter any random ID (000000 will work). This is found in the pump's Utilities (for x23 continue to Connect Devices, Remotes) and turn ON the Remote Options.\n\n\n\n\nCONGRATS...your Loop is ready for use.  But are you?  Have you read through the algorithm?  Have you watched the pump in open loop mode?  Have you read about how to safely do site changes and priming?  Do you know how to troubleshoot your Loop?  Please take the time to read the other sections of this guide as they will help you navigate safe looping practices.",

Fetch Recent History, Fetch Recent Glucose, Write Glucose History Timestamp, Get Pump Model, and Send Button Press, Read Pump Status, and Read Basal Schedule are all ways of asking the pump for information you might be interested in.  They are not part of setting up the Loop.  Send Button Press can be useful to see if the communication between the RileyLink and pump is working.  If successful, the screen on the pump will light up and Loop will confirm the button press with a \u201csuccess\u201d message.  Read Pump Status is also nice quick pump read for reservoir volume, pump battery voltage, and pump status (bolusing or suspending).",

            "text": "Now that you are done with your Loop app settings, you need to finish setting up your pump for Loop use.  Generally, the setup of the pump is similar to setting up any pump for non-looping use.  One notable exception: you will need to change those batteries more often with Looping.  Loop will drain pump batteries much faster than regular pump regimes, and Loop failures will increase in frequency as the pump battery gets low.}  While not every setting NEEDS to match between Loop and pump, it is safer to have them match in case your Loop fails and you revert back to normal pump use.  You should program the pump settings to match for:   Basal program(s)  Carb ratio  ISF  Max bolus  Insulin action duration  BG targets    Three settings in particular need to be done, OR ELSE YOUR LOOP WON'T WORK: \n    * Set \u201cmax temp basal\u201d in pump to at least equal to (or slightly greater) than the Loop\u2019s max basal \n    * Set \u201ctemp basal type\u201d to \u201cinsulin rate (u/h)\u201d \n    * Set Remote ID to \"on\" and enter any random ID (000000 will work).

            "text": "Loop Displays\n\u2301\n\n\nThis section of the docs will go over the Loop displays available and what information they offer.  Information about your Loop's actions (or inactions) can often be found simply by looking at the visuals presented in the app.  \n\n\nStatus Screen\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Status Screen is the main root navigation screen in Loop.  It is broken up into 3 main display areas; Heads Up display (HUD), Charts, and Toolbar. The HUD is the top area of the screen.  This shows status of the last time loop ran, current BG Reading, current temp-basal, current insulin reservoir volume remaining, and current pump percentage battery remaining. The next area is the charting area. This includes, glucose trend and prediction, Active Insulin, Insulin Delivery, and Carbohydrates.  The final display area is the toolbar which has buttons for Carbohydrate, Insulin Bolus, Workout Mode, and Settings.\n\n\n\n\nHeads Up Display\n\u2301\n\n\nLoop Status\n\u2301\n\n\nThe Loop Status is the colored circle in the upper left corner of the main Loop display.  There are four colors that are typically displayed.  \n\n\nA grey circle indicates the Loop is warming up and hasn\u2019t yet completed its initial loop.  When the Loop is first activated, it may take about 15-20 minutes to complete the first Loop, and the grey circle will be displayed.  It needs CGM data to be gathered, so be patient.  When it finally completes its first loop, the circle will turn green.  If you can't get the loop to turn grey, try reading the Use guide for Green Loop.\n\n\nA green circle indicates the Loop has been successfully completed within the last 5 minutes.  The time since the loop last completed will be displayed under the circle.\n\n\nA yellow circle indicates the Loop has not completed in the last 5-15 minutes.  It is not unusual to have a few instances of yellow circles throughout a day of looping.  They can be caused by temporarily getting too far away from RileyLink or iPhone (more than about 3-10 feet depending on conditions), CGM failing to read or being in ???, radio frequency \u201cnoise\u201d interference, and such.  Generally, most yellow circles will self-resolve without needing any special troubleshooting.\n\n\nA red circle indicates the Loop has not completed in over 15 minutes.  This is not a typical state, and you should troubleshoot why Loop is not completing.  Please review the Use sections' Green Loop page for troubleshooting tips.   If you have Nightscout integration, you can also use the Loop Pill to help troubleshoot.  Clicking on the red circle will also popup the last error message to help guide your troubleshooting.\n\n\nWhen the circle is notched and not complete, that means the Loop is operating in \u201copen loop\u201d mode.  When the \u201cclosed loop\u201d setting is turned on, the loop status will show a completed circle.\n\n\nThe loop status circle will pulse slightly when RileyLink is giving the pump a new temp basal setting.  The pulsing will stop when the temp basal has been set by the pump.\n\n\nGlucose\n\u2301\n\n\nThe current BG reading from the CGM will display, including trending arrow and time the reading was taken.  If the BG is being read straight from the G5 transmitter or G4 receiver, no special symbols will appear.  \n\n\nIf the BG is being read from the Dexcom Share Servers, a small cloud icon will be in the corner of the BG reading.  Internet access is required to run in this mode.\n\n\nWhen you first start Loop, there may be a small yellow alert next to the BG.  This should go away within a short period of time (around 5 minutes or less).  If the yellow alert remains, something is wrong with fetching BG data.  You can try restarting the Loop app (double tap home button, upswipe on app to close) to see if BG data will resume.  Loop will not work when a yellow BG alert is shown (\nnote G5 exception below\n).\n\n\n\n\nFor Dexcom G5 users, a yellow alert will appear when a calibration is needed.  The alert will clear once the calibration is given, but typically Loop will work IF the yellow alert is only for a needed G5 calibration.\n\n\n\n\nTemp Basal\n\u2301\n\n\nThe temp basal will display the enacted temp basal change relative to the scheduled basal.  So if the scheduled basal was 1.0 units per hour and Loop has set a temp basal of 0.2 units per hour, the temp basal icon will display -0.8 U (as shown in the graphic to the left).\n\n\nReservoir\n\u2301\n\n\nThe reservoir icon will remain grey and plain until insulin volume decreases.  At 25% reservoir volume remaining, the reservoir icon will turn yellow.  At 10% reservoir volume remaining, the reservoir icon will turn red.  The remaining units will be displayed when it gets to these lower thresholds.\n\n\nBattery\n\u2301\n\n\nFor x23, x54 pumps, the battery icon will show 100/75/50/25% increments just as the pump does.  As the battery level decreases, the icon will turn from grey to yellow to red.  For x22 pumps, the battery icon will read discrete % values.  \n\n\nCharts\n\u2301\n\n\nThere are several charts that help you navigate your Loop actions.  Clicking on each of the charts will also open up additional information.\n\n\nGlucose Chart\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe glucose chart displays BG values in your preferred units. The vertical scale of the chart is calculated on the fly by Loop to be as useful as possible while including the highest and lowest readings in the chart.\n\n\nThe horizontal axis is set to go forward from the current time until your DIA forward (so you can see what Loop eventually thinks BG will be). It then goes back in time as far as it can based upon the width in pixels of your screen. Note, if you turn your device to landscape mode you will have more screen real estate and thus will be able to see further back in time. If you would like to see further back in time you can use Nightscout or you can modify your Loop Graph hours (see the customizations available when you build your Loop app).\n\n\nThe target BG range is shown as a blue bar on the glucose chart.  If you have a single-value target BG range (such as 100-100 mg/dl), no blue range will appear.\n\n\nThe eventual BG displayed in the right side of the chart does NOT take into account a recently enacted temp basal.  In other words, if you are above BG target and Loop just enacted a high temp basal to help, the eventual BG does not reflect the expected lowering of BGs that would result from that recently enacted temp basal.  Loop waits until the insulin has actually been delivery before it \"uses\" the insulin in its calculations for BG impacts.  If you suspended your pump or had a \"no delivery\" alarm shortly after the temp basal was started, you would want that accurately reflected in the insulin on board and associated eventual BG.\n\n\nIf you tap on the Glucose Chart itself, it will open the Predicted Glucose chart\n\n\nPredicted Glucose Chart\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe predicted glucose view is a great way to gain insight into the various components\u2019 importance in Loop\u2019s prediction of eventual BG. The graph at the top of this view will match your Glucose Chart. Below this chart you will see a very detailed explanation of all of the variables that Loop takes into account in predicting your future BG value. Each of those effects (including Carbohydrates, Insulin, Glucose Momentum and Retrospective Correction) includes details of the calculation use. You can tap on any of the entries to turn them off and on for visualization. The resulting changes can be viewed by the changes in the dashed lines.\n\n\nAdditionally, at the bottom of this screen there is a setting to \u201cEnable Retrospective Correction\u201d. By enabling it, it will more aggressively increase or decrease basal delivery when BG movement doesn\u2019t match the carbohydrates and insulin-based model.  You can read more about this setting in the Algorithm section of these docs.\n\n\nActive Insulin Chart\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Active Insulin chart displays the total insulin contribution from both temp basals and boluses.  Active IOB can be either positive and negative IOB.  Negative IOB results from the suspension of normally scheduled basals.  The active insulin displayed in the upper right corner of the chart does NOT include insulin contributions from a recently enacted temp basal or bolus until the pump\u2019s reservoir volume is read and confirms a drop in reservoir volume (confirming the insulin has actually been delivered).\n\n\nInsulin Delivery Chart\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Insulin Delivery chart displays a history of the temp basals enacted by Loop.  The display is relative to the scheduled basal rates entered in the Loop settings.  So, a rate displayed in this chart as \u201c+0 units\u201d would indicate no temp basal was set, and Loop defaulted to the scheduled basal rate.  Individual boluses are indicated by an orange triangle on the chart (shown in the graphic above, near the left-most time).  The total insulin delivered, including all basals and boluses, is given in the upper right corner of the graph.\n\n\nPlease be patient for a bolus delivery to appear.  There is a lag time from when you press the \u201cdeliver\u201d bolus button.  The insulin has to be delivered and then the pump reservoir needs to be read to confirm delivery, before the triangle will appear and IOB will be added.  On large boluses, the time to actually deliver the bolus may be several minutes.\n\n\nReservoir and Event History\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClicking on either the Active Insulin or Insulin Delivery charts will open your Insulin Delivery history.  The top of the screen will display the current IOB and the total insulin delivered for the day since midnight (or since the time the loop became active if you started Loop after midnight).  There are two viewing options; Reservoir or Event History.  \n\n\nLoop\u2019s default is to use actual reservoir volumes for determining the insulin delivered.  When there is a gap of 30 minutes or more in reservoir history, Loop classifies these readings as \u201cnot continuous\u201d and therefore unreliable for the purposes of determining insulin deliveries.  Therefore in those instances, Loop will rely on the event histories to determine insulin deliveries during the non-continuous times.  \n\n\nThe reservoir volume history can also be intentionally edited to cause a \u201cnot continuous\u201d instance.

A grey circle indicates the Loop is warming up and hasn\u2019t yet completed its initial loop.  When the Loop is first activated, it may take about 15-20 minutes to complete the first Loop, and the grey circle will be displayed.  It needs CGM data to be gathered, so be patient.  When it finally completes its first loop, the circle will turn green.  If you can't get the loop to turn grey, try reading the Use guide for Green Loop.  A green circle indicates the Loop has been successfully completed within the last 5 minutes.  The time since the loop last completed will be displayed under the circle.  A yellow circle indicates the Loop has not completed in the last 5-15 minutes.  It is not unusual to have a few instances of yellow circles throughout a day of looping.  They can be caused by temporarily getting too far away from RileyLink or iPhone (more than about 3-10 feet depending on conditions), CGM failing to read or being in ???, radio frequency \u201cnoise\u201d interference, and such.  Generally, most yellow circles will self-resolve without needing any special troubleshooting.  A red circle indicates the Loop has not completed in over 15 minutes.  This is not a typical state, and you should troubleshoot why Loop is not completing.  Please review the Use sections' Green Loop page for troubleshooting tips.   If you have Nightscout integration, you can also use the Loop Pill to help troubleshoot.  Clicking on the red circle will also popup the last error message to help guide your troubleshooting.  When the circle is notched and not complete, that means the Loop is operating in \u201copen loop\u201d mode.  When the \u201cclosed loop\u201d setting is turned on, the loop status will show a completed circle.

When you first start Loop, there may be a small yellow alert next to the BG.  This should go away within a short period of time (around 5 minutes or less).

If you would like to see further back in time you can use Nightscout or you can modify your Loop Graph hours (see the customizations available when you build your Loop app).  The target BG range is shown as a blue bar on the glucose chart.  If you have a single-value target BG range (such as 100-100 mg/dl), no blue range will appear.  The eventual BG displayed in the right side of the chart does NOT take into account a recently enacted temp basal.  In other words, if you are above BG target and Loop just enacted a high temp basal to help, the eventual BG does not reflect the expected lowering of BGs that would result from that recently enacted temp basal.  Loop waits until the insulin has actually been delivery before it \"uses\" the insulin in its calculations for BG impacts.  If you suspended your pump or had a \"no delivery\" alarm shortly after the temp basal was started, you would want that accurately reflected in the insulin on board and associated eventual BG.

            "text": "Open Loop\n\u2301\n\n\nOpen loop is a great place to start with Loop. When you are operating in open loop mode, Loop is offering recommedendations for temp basals and will display them on the main screen.  The recommendations will not be enacted unless you specifically choose to enact the temp basal.  Usually in open loop mode, you aren't really enacting the recommended basals but instead watching how the recommendations come in and figuring out WHY they are being recommended.\n\n\nIt is understandable to want to jump straight away into close loop mode, but a lot can be learned by watching Loop operate in open mode.  Becoming familiar with the algorithm can be easier by watching it in action rather than only reading about it in docs.\n\n\nTesting\n\u2301\n\n\nA great benefit of open loop mode is that you can establish a baseline of BG trends without the influence of temp basals from Loop.  This is particularly helpful if you haven't used Medtronic sites/pumps prior to Loop.  You may find that your basal rates change significantly coming from other brands of pumps.  Taking the time to establish a good Medtronic pump basal profile will set you up for a smoother transition to close loop mode.  Test your ISF during open loop time too, as ISF is an important component for every Loop calculation for temp basals.  Every 5 minutes, Loop uses your ISF...so it's worth testing it ahead of close loop mode.\n\n\nEventual BG\n\u2301\n\n\nOne of the best things you can do is to train yourself to watch the eventual BG rather than the current BG for helping understand Loop recommendations for temp basals.  So many of us have become accustomed to dealing with current BGs and perhaps IOB at the same time...but Loop is also looking at BG momentum, carbs on board, restrospective trends.  Loop is utilizing all of those variables to predict an eventual BG.  It's current decisions are based on that eventual BG.  Training yourself to watch that eventual BG will help you understand the temp basals being offered at any given time.\n\n\nCarb Absorption\n\u2301\n\n\nProbably the next most difficult transition involves using carb absorption as a component to every meal bolus.  Understand that the default carb absorption times in Loop may not work for your particular body.  Similar to how you perhaps had used extended boluses for meals that impacted BGs longer than the duration of your insulin...that same idea applies to estimating your carb absorption times.  Watch your meals and try to estimate how long they are impacting your BG for various types of food.  Watch the times when Loop would've wanted to suspend or high temp basal...ask yourself why it would be doing that.  Especially ask yourself if that is the same decision as you would've made at that time in a meal normally.  Would you be worried that you might go low later if you see Loop offering high temp basal early after a meal?  Would you be worried about going high later if Loop wants to suspend basals instead?  If you put some effort into this effort before closing the loop, it will pay off with a smoother transition to closed loop.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\u2301\n\n\nGet used to carrying the RileyLink around.  Find how far your connectivity stretches before you have pump communication problems.  Get used to troubleshooting yellow and red loops, finding out the pattern/cause of any potential loop issues.  You'll be less frustrated starting on closed loop if you aren't dealing with learning new electronics at the same time as you are learning carb absorption times in a closed loop.  Learn how to retune your RL. \n\n\nBolus\n\u2301\n\n\nBolus meals from the Loop, rather than the pump.  Become familiar with entering carbs into the Loop, as well as editing them.  Watch how long it takes for Loop app to display the bolus after you enact it (hint: there's a delay until the bolus finishes delivery and the pump gets read).  Familiarize yourself with the \"Bolus May Have Failed\" notifications and how to handle them.  Double check the pump and watch to see if the bolus indeed didn't enact before trying to give the bolus again.  \n\n\nCaregiver training\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you are the parent of a t1d kid using Loop, make sure you take the time to educate caregivers around your family and school for how to use Loop.  Perhaps you want to draft individualized quick info sheets for those caregivers to use with Loop.  If your child needs a site change at school, school staff or your child need to know how to delete reservoir history or change to open loop for the duration of DIA.  Try to watch Nightscout while you get to know Loop so that you can become better at remote troubleshooting of any problems that you might encounter.",

Starting close loop on weekends is an easier starting point so that you can minimize distractions (let's face it...you'll probably be staring at the Loop a lot for those first few days). Typically, people have an easier time transitioning to close loop for parts of their day that don't involve food...so nighttimes tend to be easier than daytimes to start.\n\n\nMaximum Basal Rate\n\u2301\n\n\nWhen you are first beginning to close loop, it is important to be conservative (low) in setting your maximum basal rate.  If your settings are incorrect in other areas (basal rates, carb absorption time, carb ratio, etc), Loop may enact incorrectly aggressive high temp basals.  Gradually increase your maximum basal rate as your comfort and confidence in Loop increase.

If you find that you are \"carrying\" positive or negative IOB consistently, you should review your settings to see if perhaps your basal or ISF needs adjusting.\n\n\nMeals\n\u2301\n\n\nMeals will likely be the hardest part of transitioning to close loop.  Starting with foods that you have a high comfort level with is a great idea.  If you have favorite meals that you know well (how high BGs usually go, how much to bolus, how to prebolus, etc), these would be a good starting point.

However, in the real world, carb absorption is quite variable.  Dynamic carb absorption model is able to model some of this variability and allow Loop to respond more reasonably when actual carb absorption is not matching well with the selected carb absorption time for a meal.  In short, while entering a carb absorption time is still part of recording meals in Loop, it is much less critical to get it right.

Entries from 3rd party apps can not be removed from within Loop.  You will have to edit them in the third party app, or from the Health app. Because of this potential for confusion, it is recommended to turn off Loop's ability to read other apps' carbohydrate data from HealthKit.

After a carb entry is made, Loop will provide a bolus screen with a recommended bolus amount.  If you want to deliver the total amount of the recommended bolus, simply tap on the recommended amount of units and the bolus delivery line will automatically be filled-in with the same units.  If you want to give fewer units than the recommended amount, you can manually enter the desired amount to be delivered.   \n\n\nThe Bolus Wizard will not offer a recommended bolus if your BG is below, or predicted to go below, your specified Minimum BG Guard.  A screen will appear letting you know the reason no bolus is being recommended as well as the status of your active COB and IOB.  You can choose to override that warning and give a bolus, or treat the low BG and come back to the bolus tool when your BG has recovered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrection Bolus\n\u2301\n\n\nOccasionally, a recommended bolus will be offered in the bolus screen unrelated to a recent carb entry.  In those cases, Loop is calculating that it will not be able to stay in target range through the use of max temp basals alone and is offering a \u201ccorrection bolus\u201d.

In a well-run loop with decent carb counting, correction boluses should be infrequently needed.\n\n\nPart of Loop's predictions for future BG changes include a component called BG momentum. Loop looks at the previous three BG readings and calculates a best-fit-straight-line for those three points. In other words, it tries to draw a future trend line using the last three BG data points. Loop extends that line 30 minutes into the future and gives a fair amount of weight to that component of the BG prediction. In instances of rapidly changing BGs, BG momentum may overestimate the rise/fall of BG.

If you set your Workout Target to 80 mg/dl - 80 mg/dl for an hour before a meal, this will help Loop to deliver additional insulin prior to the meal, and help control post-prandial BGs.  The Loop will account for the amount of insulin it has prebolused when it offers the recommended bolus for the meal.\n\n\nBolus Strategies\n\u2301\n\n\nUnfortunately, Loop cannot enact temp basals while the pump is delivering a square wave or dual wave bolus.  Therefore, we recommend that you find alternate bolusing strategies for situation where you would've previously used those extended bolusing techniques.\n\n\nWhile you adapt to new bolusing techniques, it is important to monitor closely to see what works for you.

Numerous factors can influence how well those communications can function...interferences from other devices, temperature, physical blocking, etc.\n\n\nKnowing a little about the strength of the radio communications will help you troubleshoot Loop errors.  When you \nTune Radio Frequency\n in the Riley Link menu, it is testing for the strongest frequency to communicate with the pump.  Usually this frequency is pretty constant, but during temperature changes it may be that the best frequency is not the one currently set.  The tuning results also show which frequency is the strongest.\n\n\nFor example, in the screenshot below, the strength of the radio communications with the pump is shown by the last number of the tune.  Frequencies with tuning results of -99 means NO communications were established at that frequency.  RileyLink will use the strongest frequency tune for its pump communications.  In the screenshot, the best frequency returned a result of \n-37\n at a frequency of \n916.60 MHz\n, so RileyLink will set that \n916.60 MHz\n for its pump communications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, if you have tuning in the -90s, your RileyLink-pump communications will not work.  If you have tuning in the -80s, you may have periodic communication failures.  If your tuning is in the -70s or better, your communications should be pretty stable.  \n\n\nExperiment with your RileyLink by moving it closer and farther away from the pump.  Try putting it on the other side of your body, or put it in a purse.  Test the tuning results in real world situations that you think you'd be encountering, such as where you will have the RileyLink placed during overnight charging. Perform tunes at the various distances and situations.  This will help you understand how far from the pump your RileyLink can get before it will affect Loop performance.  \n\n\nBluetooth\n\u2301\n\n\nRileyLink communicates with your iPhone and Loop app through Bluetooth (BT).  If your iPhone has BT issues, your Loop will have failures.  There have been reports of BT audio devices (such as BT pairings in your car or home audio BT speakers) interfering with the Loop.  If you are finding Loop failures frequently happening at a particular location, you may try to troubleshoot if there are BT problems in the area.\n\n\nYour BT signal strength can be seen in the Loop settings, under the RileyLink menu, on the \nSignal Strength\n line.  As you move closer and further away from your phone, you can watch that number dynamically change.

There is no 'power' light.  If you suspect that your RileyLink is not being powered, try turning it off and on using the small sliding switch.  You should see lights in the middle of the board flash when you do this.  If they flash, that means the board has power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed light: Charging light.  The red light will remain on while RileyLink is charging, and it will turn off when charging is complete.  You may notice the red light turn on periodically even after charging is complete...it's just \"topping off\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreen light: Bluetooth connection light.  The green light will remain on while you have BT connection with your iPhone.  If that green light fails to stay on, you should troubleshoot your BT connections.  Try restarting BT on your iPhone and/or turning the RileyLink off/on by its power switch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue light: Pump communications.  If you have an older firmware on your RileyLink, some of the blue and green lights will flash periodically as it is communicating with the pump.

Typically, it can go into the 30-hour range without problem.  Most people charge their RileyLink each night when they are sleeping.  You don't have to worry about leaving the RileyLink plugged in \"too long\" for charging.  It will automatically stop charging the battery when it is fully charged.\n\n\nRange\n\u2301\n\n\nThe range that your RileyLink will function is \nheavily\n dependent on the environment that you are in. Read the section about Tuning to help determine how far your RileyLink can dependably maintain an adequate signal strength in your particular environment.  Most people wear the RileyLink in a pocket or carry a belt holster during the day.  Typically, RileyLink will need to be closer to the pump than the iPhone.  The radio frequency communications will have a shorter range than the BT communications.\n\n\nLipo Battery\n\u2301\n\n\nIf you ordered your RileyLink preassembled, you should plug in the battery cable.  Please make sure your RileyLink\u2019s battery cable is securely pushed all the way into the socket.

Numerous factors can influence how well those communications can function...interferences from other devices, temperature, physical blocking, etc.  Knowing a little about the strength of the radio communications will help you troubleshoot Loop errors.  When you  Tune Radio Frequency  in the Riley Link menu, it is testing for the strongest frequency to communicate with the pump.  Usually this frequency is pretty constant, but during temperature changes it may be that the best frequency is not the one currently set.  The tuning results also show which frequency is the strongest.  For example, in the screenshot below, the strength of the radio communications with the pump is shown by the last number of the tune.  Frequencies with tuning results of -99 means NO communications were established at that frequency.  RileyLink will use the strongest frequency tune for its pump communications.  In the screenshot, the best frequency returned a result of  -37  at a frequency of  916.60 MHz , so RileyLink will set that  916.60 MHz  for its pump communications.     Generally, if you have tuning in the -90s, your RileyLink-pump communications will not work.  If you have tuning in the -80s, you may have periodic communication failures.  If your tuning is in the -70s or better, your communications should be pretty stable.    Experiment with your RileyLink by moving it closer and farther away from the pump.  Try putting it on the other side of your body, or put it in a purse.  Test the tuning results in real world situations that you think you'd be encountering, such as where you will have the RileyLink placed during overnight charging. Perform tunes at the various distances and situations.  This will help you understand how far from the pump your RileyLink can get before it will affect Loop performance.",

It allows for easy remote monitoring of Loop activities, troubleshooting of Loop errors, history of CGM, carbs, boluses, \n temp basals, reports to analyze data trends and patterns. There is a Nightscout app in your iPhone App Store, or you can use a web browser to view the data.  Setting up Nightscout is free and fairly quick.  Once setup, the site can be accessed by anyone that you share your unique Nightscout URL with.  \n\n\nNightscout is highly recommended for Loop users, especially those using Loop as caregivers to t1ds.  Nightscout displays are often the easiest way to troubleshoot Loop settings, if you are having problems and seeking input from others.  Below is some discussion about the general Nightscout display, as well as some Loop-specific display information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlood Glucose\n\n\nYour blood glucose (BG) readings from your CGM are shown in green, yellow, or red in the main graph area of NS.  You can adjust your high and low BG targets in NS (when NS alerts will start for high/low BGs), but those will not affect your Loop performance.  Loop only uses the BG targets given in the Loop app settings.  The main screen of BGs is displaying the time duration you have selected (in the example above, 12 hours of BG history).  The bottom of the screen shows the last 48-hours of BG trends.  You can scan backwards by dragging the bottom timeline to the left, if you want to review specific Loop actions or data in the last two days. \n\n\n\n\nCarbs\n\n\nCarbs are automatically uploaded to NS by the Loop app.  The amount of carbs on board (active carbs or COB) can be seen by clicking the Loop pill.  The size of a white carb dot on the graph is proportional to the amount of carbs entered...bigger meals get bigger dots. Loop does not read carbs from NS for use in looping caluclations, it only uploads carbs to NS that have been entered in the Loop app.\n\n\n\n\nBoluses\n\n\nInsulin boluses are also automatically uploaded to NS by the Loop app.  The bolus is shown as a filled in blue lower-half of the dot, and the specific amount of the bolus is also shown.  There may be a slight delay between when the carbs for a meal are uploaded to NS to when the meal bolus appears.  This is because depending on the pump model and size of bolus, the bolus may take a few minutes to actually be given and then Loop has to perform a pump read to verify the reservoir volume has decreased (i.e., the bolus was given).  As shown in the example above, the meal carbs have been uploaded, but the bolus delivery is still in progress.  Insulin on board (active insulin or IOB) is also shown in the Loop pill.\n\n\n\n\nTemp Basals\n\n\nWithin your NS profile, you will enter in the scheduled basal for your t1d.  This is not automatically updated when you update the Loop app or your pump; you will have to manually update your basal profile in your NS site if you change your basal profile in Loop and/or pump.  If you don't update the NS basal profile, it doesn't cause any problems in Loop function...you simply won't have accurate VISUAL representation of high/low temp basals within NS. The dashed blue line represents the scheduled basal profile (as entered in your NS profile).  The solid blue lines indicate the actual basal amounts set for a given time...so as Loop sets temp basals higher or lower than your scheduled basal rate, the solid blue line will jump above or below your dashed blue line.  There is a slight delay (up to 2-5 minutes) in the rendering of basal changes on the blue lines, so if you want the accurate current basal rate, you can check the Loop pill.\n\n\n\n\nPredicted BG\n\n\nThe purple line to the right of the BG is Loop's predicted BG.  Watching the behavior of that purple line can help you understand why Loop is making decisions regarding high or low temps.  You can read more on that topic in the Algorithm section of these docs.\n\n\n\n\nLoop pill\n\n\nThe Loop pill is the little display box which when hovered over, or clicked, will provide additional information about recent Loop activities and status.  Information included is the last time Loop ran, the temp basal set, IOB, and COB.  Looking at the Loop pill is a quick method for assessing if you loop is currently active, as well.  The small symbols to the right of the word Loop have specific meaning.  The small horizontal lightning bolt, shown in this example, is an active loop which recently enacted a temp basal.  You can read the section on Troubleshooting using the Loop Pill for additional information about the various symbols.\n\n\n\n\nSAGE and CAGE pills\n\n\nThe SAGE and CAGE pills are for Sensor Age and Cannula Age.  These optional pills track the time since your CGM sensor and Pump site were last changed.  You can set up custom alerts to remind you when it is time to change the devices, or simply use the visuals to keep track of your particular timing for site/sensor changes.",

Nightscout displays are often the easiest way to troubleshoot Loop settings, if you are having problems and seeking input from others.  Below is some discussion about the general Nightscout display, as well as some Loop-specific display information.       Blood Glucose  Your blood glucose (BG) readings from your CGM are shown in green, yellow, or red in the main graph area of NS.  You can adjust your high and low BG targets in NS (when NS alerts will start for high/low BGs), but those will not affect your Loop performance.  Loop only uses the BG targets given in the Loop app settings.  The main screen of BGs is displaying the time duration you have selected (in the example above, 12 hours of BG history).  The bottom of the screen shows the last 48-hours of BG trends.  You can scan backwards by dragging the bottom timeline to the left, if you want to review specific Loop actions or data in the last two days.    Carbs  Carbs are automatically uploaded to NS by the Loop app.  The amount of carbs on board (active carbs or COB) can be seen by clicking the Loop pill.  The size of a white carb dot on the graph is proportional to the amount of carbs entered...bigger meals get bigger dots. Loop does not read carbs from NS for use in looping caluclations, it only uploads carbs to NS that have been entered in the Loop app.   Boluses  Insulin boluses are also automatically uploaded to NS by the Loop app.  The bolus is shown as a filled in blue lower-half of the dot, and the specific amount of the bolus is also shown.  There may be a slight delay between when the carbs for a meal are uploaded to NS to when the meal bolus appears.  This is because depending on the pump model and size of bolus, the bolus may take a few minutes to actually be given and then Loop has to perform a pump read to verify the reservoir volume has decreased (i.e., the bolus was given).  As shown in the example above, the meal carbs have been uploaded, but the bolus delivery is still in progress.  Insulin on board (active insulin or IOB) is also shown in the Loop pill.   Temp Basals  Within your NS profile, you will enter in the scheduled basal for your t1d.  This is not automatically updated when you update the Loop app or your pump; you will have to manually update your basal profile in your NS site if you change your basal profile in Loop and/or pump.  If you don't update the NS basal profile, it doesn't cause any problems in Loop function...you simply won't have accurate VISUAL representation of high/low temp basals within NS. The dashed blue line represents the scheduled basal profile (as entered in your NS profile).  The solid blue lines indicate the actual basal amounts set for a given time...so as Loop sets temp basals higher or lower than your scheduled basal rate, the solid blue line will jump above or below your dashed blue line.  There is a slight delay (up to 2-5 minutes) in the rendering of basal changes on the blue lines, so if you want the accurate current basal rate, you can check the Loop pill.   Predicted BG  The purple line to the right of the BG is Loop's predicted BG.  Watching the behavior of that purple line can help you understand why Loop is making decisions regarding high or low temps.  You can read more on that topic in the Algorithm section of these docs.   Loop pill  The Loop pill is the little display box which when hovered over, or clicked, will provide additional information about recent Loop activities and status.  Information included is the last time Loop ran, the temp basal set, IOB, and COB.  Looking at the Loop pill is a quick method for assessing if you loop is currently active, as well.  The small symbols to the right of the word Loop have specific meaning.  The small horizontal lightning bolt, shown in this example, is an active loop which recently enacted a temp basal.  You can read the section on Troubleshooting using the Loop Pill for additional information about the various symbols.   SAGE and CAGE pills  The SAGE and CAGE pills are for Sensor Age and Cannula Age.  These optional pills track the time since your CGM sensor and Pump site were last changed.  You can set up custom alerts to remind you when it is time to change the devices, or simply use the visuals to keep track of your particular timing for site/sensor changes.",

When you hit that data cap, your NS will stop working.  Your Share Bridge will not pull data and your site will be \u201cstale\u201d.  \n\n\nThe good news?  Loop can still run just fine until you cleanout and/or compact your mLab database.  The bad news?  You just won\u2019t be able to remotely monitor Loop through NS until you clear up some storage space in mLab.\n\n\nNote there are two areas where the 500 MB data limit can be an issue.  One is called the \nsize\n which is the actual data stored in your database.  The other is called \nsize on disk\n which is the virtual space that your database takes up.  As data is written onto your free database, sometimes it is written inefficiently and virtually \"spreads out\" to take up more room.  Depending on where your issue is, you may need to delete or cleanout data (if \nsize\n is the issue) or you may just need to compact data (if \nsize on disk\n is the issue).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCleanout mLab\n\u2301\n\n\nThere are two ways to cleanout space and delete data in your mLab database:\n\n\n\n\nmLab direct access\n\n\nNightscout admin tools\n\n\n\n\nmLab Direct Access\n\u2301\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin to your mLab database.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you setup your own Azure site and mLab database, go directly to \nmLab\n and login, or\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you setup your own Azure site and mLab database, then setup a Heroku account and pointed back to your old mLab database (i.e., copy and pasted the MONGODB_URI from Azure), go directly to \nmLab\n and login, or\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you setup a Heroku site and let Heroku setup an mLab database for you (which is typical for new Heroku sites), you will access mLab through your Heroku account main page.   Login to your Heroku account and click on the mLab logo as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Users coming directly from a Heroku click will see the screen below.  If you had to login to mLab with a name and password, you will first see a line with your MongoDB database.  Click on your database name to see the screen below with all the collection names.) \n\n\nYour various collections are shown, similar to the screen shot below.  The amount of data each collection is using is listed to the far right of each collection\u2019s line.  I recommend emptying the \u201cloop\u201d collection first and then \"devicestatus\" to free up database storage.  If you need any of the information in the database, you may want to do a selective delete of data. For example, if you are headed into an endocrinologist appointment and want to print out recent Nightscout reports to take with you. Eventually you may need to empty more collections.  It should be awhile though, as the other collections are significantly smaller and will take a long time to fill.\n\n\nClick on a collection\u2019s name to open it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the button that says \u201cDelete all documents in collection\u201d and then confirm the deletion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can confirm that your cleanout has resolved the problem, by checking that your database size is below 500 MB now.  Click on the \nHome\n link in top left.

Loop can still run just fine until you cleanout and/or compact your mLab database.  The bad news?  You just won\u2019t be able to remotely monitor Loop through NS until you clear up some storage space in mLab.  Note there are two areas where the 500 MB data limit can be an issue.  One is called the  size  which is the actual data stored in your database.  The other is called  size on disk  which is the virtual space that your database takes up.  As data is written onto your free database, sometimes it is written inefficiently and virtually \"spreads out\" to take up more room.  Depending on where your issue is, you may need to delete or cleanout data (if  size  is the issue) or you may just need to compact data (if  size on disk  is the issue).",
